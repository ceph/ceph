Context
These dashboards should be enough to get started on the integration. It's not a complete set, so more will be added in the next week.

Bare in mind that the osd device details dashboard needs node_exporter active - all the other dashboards pick data out of ceph-mgr based metrics.


The cephfs dashboard only has 2 panels currently. The counter available are
a little light at the moment. Patrick/Venky have been addressing this with
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1618523

Host Information
host-details.json combines generic server metrics that show cpu/memory/network stats (including network errors/drops),
with disk level stats for OSD hosts. OSD charts show the physical device name together with it's corresponding osd id for correlation.

Ceph Pools
two dashboards. Overview gives the high level combined view, pool-detail needs a pool_name variable passed to it (currently uses a templating var which is visible)
pool-overview.json
pool-detail.json

OSD Device Details. This dashboard needs some further work. It currently shows
OSD level stats with physical device stats but leaves out some of the counters
that cephmetrics provides for trouble shooting.
osd-device-details.json

Object gateway dashboards, again split into overview and detail. The detail dashboard needs the relevant ceph-deamon name for the rgw instance.
