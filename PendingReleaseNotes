>=18.0.0

* RGW's default backend for `rgw_enable_ops_log` changed from RADOS to file.
  The default value of `rgw_ops_log_rados` is now false, and `rgw_ops_log_file_path`
  defaults to "/var/log/ceph/ops-log-$cluster-$name.log".
* The SPDK backend for BlueStore is now able to connect to an NVMeoF target.
  Please note that this is not an officially supported feature.
* RGW's pubsub interface now returns boolean fields using bool. Before this change,
  `/topics/<topic-name>` returns "stored_secret" and "persistent" using a string
  of "true" or "false" with quotes around them. After this change, these fields
  are returned without quotes so they can be decoded as boolean values in JSON.
  The same applies to the `is_truncated` field returned by `/subscriptions/<sub-name>`.
* RGW's response of `Action=GetTopicAttributes&TopicArn=<topic-arn>` REST API now
  returns `HasStoredSecret` and `Persistent` as boolean in the JSON string
  encoded in `Attributes/EndPoint`.
* All boolean fields previously rendered as string by `rgw-admin` command when
  the JSON format is used are now rendered as boolean. If your scripts/tools
  relies on this behavior, please update them accordingly. The impacted field names
  are:
  * absolute
  * add
  * admin
  * appendable
  * bucket_key_enabled
  * delete_marker
  * exists
  * has_bucket_info
  * high_precision_time
  * index
  * is_master
  * is_prefix
  * is_truncated
  * linked
  * log_meta
  * log_op
  * pending_removal
  * read_only
  * retain_head_object
  * rule_exist
  * start_with_full_sync
  * sync_from_all
  * syncstopped
  * system
  * truncated
  * user_stats_sync
* RGW: The beast frontend's HTTP access log line uses a new debug_rgw_access
  configurable. This has the same defaults as debug_rgw, but can now be controlled
  independently.
* RBD: The semantics of compare-and-write C++ API (`Image::compare_and_write`
  and `Image::aio_compare_and_write` methods) now match those of C API.  Both
  compare and write steps operate only on `len` bytes even if the respective
  buffers are larger. The previous behavior of comparing up to the size of
  the compare buffer was prone to subtle breakage upon straddling a stripe
  unit boundary.
* RBD: compare-and-write operation is no longer limited to 512-byte sectors.
  Assuming proper alignment, it now allows operating on stripe units (4M by
  default).
* The 'AT_NO_ATTR_SYNC' macro is deprecated, please use the standard 'AT_STATX_DONT_SYNC'
  macro. The 'AT_NO_ATTR_SYNC' macro will be removed in the future.

>=17.2.1

* The "BlueStore zero block detection" feature (first introduced to Quincy in
https://github.com/ceph/ceph/pull/43337) has been turned off by default with a
new global configuration called `bluestore_zero_block_detection`. This feature,
intended for large-scale synthetic testing, does not interact well with some RBD
and CephFS features. Any side effects experienced in previous Quincy versions
would no longer occur, provided that the configuration remains set to false.

* telemetry: Added new Rook metrics to the 'basic' channel to report Rook's
  version, Kubernetes version, node metrics, etc.
  See a sample report with `ceph telemetry preview`.
  Opt-in with `ceph telemetry on`.

* Filestore has been deprecated in Quincy, considering that BlueStore has been
  the default objectstore for quite some time.

* Critical bug in OMAP format upgrade is fixed. This could cause data corruption
  (improperly formatted OMAP keys) after pre-Pacific cluster upgrade if
  bluestore-quick-fix-on-mount parameter is set to true or ceph-bluestore-tool's
  quick-fix/repair commands are invoked.
  Relevant tracker: https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/53062

* `ceph-mgr-modules-core` debian package does not recommend `ceph-mgr-rook`
  anymore. As the latter depends on `python3-numpy` which cannot be imported in
  different Python sub-interpreters multi-times if the version of
  `python3-numpy` is older than 1.19. Since `apt-get` installs the `Recommends`
  packages by default, `ceph-mgr-rook` was always installed along with
  `ceph-mgr` debian package as an indirect dependency. If your workflow depends
  on this behavior, you might want to install `ceph-mgr-rook` separately.

* the "kvs" Ceph object class is not packaged anymore. "kvs" Ceph object class
  offers a distributed flat b-tree key-value store implemented on top of librados
  objects omap. Because we don't have existing internal users of this object
  class, it is not packaged anymore.

* A new library is available, libcephsqlite. It provides a SQLite Virtual File
  System (VFS) on top of RADOS. The database and journals are striped over
  RADOS across multiple objects for virtually unlimited scaling and throughput
  only limited by the SQLite client. Applications using SQLite may change to
  the Ceph VFS with minimal changes, usually just by specifying the alternate
  VFS. We expect the library to be most impactful and useful for applications
  that were storing state in RADOS omap, especially without striping which
  limits scalability.

* The ``device_health_metrics`` pool has been renamed ``.mgr``. It is now
  used as a common store for all ``ceph-mgr`` modules.

* fs: A file system can be created with a specific ID ("fscid"). This is useful
  in certain recovery scenarios, e.g., monitor database lost and rebuilt, and
  the restored file system is expected to have the same ID as before.

* fs: A file system can be renamed using the `fs rename` command. Any cephx
  credentials authorized for the old file system name will need to be
  reauthorized to the new file system name. Since the operations of the clients
  using these re-authorized IDs may be disrupted, this command requires the
  "--yes-i-really-mean-it" flag. Also, mirroring is expected to be disabled
  on the file system.
* MDS upgrades no longer require stopping all standby MDS daemons before
  upgrading the sole active MDS for a file system.

* Parquet implementation is about accessing columnar objects(Parquet format) 
  using Parquet reader(apache arrow) that will eventually save a lot of IOPS.
  The s3select-engine(RGW submodule) contains that Parquet-reader.
  The Parquet object is identified by its name(*.parquet) and by the magic-number exists 
  in objects.

* RGW: RGW now supports rate limiting by user and/or by bucket.
  With this feature it is possible to limit user and/or bucket, the total operations and/or
  bytes per minute can be delivered.
  This feature is allowing the admin to limit only READ operations and/or WRITE operations.
  The rate limiting configuration could be applied on all users and all bucket by using 
  global configuration.

* RGW: `radosgw-admin realm delete` is now renamed to `radosgw-admin realm rm`. This
  is consistent with the help message.

* OSD: Ceph now uses mclock_scheduler for bluestore OSDs as its default osd_op_queue
  to provide QoS. The 'mclock_scheduler' is not supported for filestore OSDs.
  Therefore, the default 'osd_op_queue' is set to 'wpq' for filestore OSDs
  and is enforced even if the user attempts to change it.

* CephFS: Failure to replay the journal by a standby-replay daemon will now
  cause the rank to be marked damaged.

* RGW: S3 bucket notification events now contain an `eTag` key instead of `etag`,
  and eventName values no longer carry the `s3:` prefix, fixing deviations from
  the message format observed on AWS.

* RGW: It is possible to specify ssl options and ciphers for beast frontend now.
  The default ssl options setting is "no_sslv2:no_sslv3:no_tlsv1:no_tlsv1_1".
  If you want to return back the old behavior add 'ssl_options=' (empty) to
  ``rgw frontends`` configuration.

* RGW: The behavior for Multipart Upload was modified so that only 
  CompleteMultipartUpload notification is sent at the end of the multipart upload. 
  The POST notification at the beginning of the upload, and PUT notifications that 
  were sent on each part are not sent anymore.

* MGR: The pg_autoscaler has a new 'scale-down' profile which provides more
  performance from the start for new pools. However, the module will remain
  using it old behavior by default, now called the 'scale-up' profile.
  For more details, see:

  https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/rados/operations/placement-groups/

* MGR: The pg_autoscaler can now be turned `on` and `off` globally
  with the `noautoscale` flag. By default this flag is unset and
  the default pg_autoscale mode remains the same.

  For more details, see:

  https://docs.ceph.com/en/latest/mgr/telemetry/

>=15.2.17

* OSD: Octopus modified the SnapMapper key format from
  <LEGACY_MAPPING_PREFIX><snapid>_<shardid>_<hobject_t::to_str()>
  to
  <MAPPING_PREFIX><pool>_<snapid>_<shardid>_<hobject_t::to_str()>
  When this change was introduced, 94ebe0e also introduced a conversion
  with a crucial bug which essentially destroyed legacy keys by mapping them
  to
  <MAPPING_PREFIX><poolid>_<snapid>_
  without the object-unique suffix. The conversion is fixed in this release.
  Relevant tracker: https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/56147
  
* Cephadm may now be configured to carry out CephFS MDS upgrades without
reducing ``max_mds`` to 1. Previously, Cephadm would reduce ``max_mds`` to 1 to
avoid having two active MDS modifying on-disk structures with new versions,
communicating cross-version-incompatible messages, or other potential
incompatibilities. This could be disruptive for large-scale CephFS deployments
because the cluster cannot easily reduce active MDS daemons to 1.
NOTE: Staggered upgrade of the mons/mgrs may be necessary to take advantage
of the feature, refer this link on how to perform it:
