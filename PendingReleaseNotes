>=14.2.2
--------

* Nautilus-based librbd clients can now open images on Jewel clusters.

* The RGW "num_rados_handles" has been removed.
  If you were using a value of "num_rados_handles" greater than 1
  multiply your current "objecter_inflight_ops" and
  "objecter_inflight_op_bytes" paramaeters by the old
  "num_rados_handles" to get the same throttle behavior.

14.2.2
------

* The no{up,down,in,out} related commands has been revamped.
  There are now 2 ways to set the no{up,down,in,out} flags:
  the old 'ceph osd [un]set <flag>' command, which sets cluster-wide flags;
  and the new 'ceph osd [un]set-group <flags> <who>' command,
  which sets flags in batch at the granularity of any crush node,
  or device class.

* RGW: radosgw-admin introduces two subcommands that allow the
  managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a
  bucket reshard in earlier versions of RGW. One subcommand lists such
  objects and the other deletes them. Read the troubleshooting section
  of the dynamic resharding docs for details.

* A health warning is now generated if the average osd heartbeat ping
  time exceeds a configurable threshold for any of the intervals
  computed.  The OSD computes 1 minute, 5 minute and 15 minute
  intervals with average, minimum and maximum values.  New configuration
  option ``mon_warn_on_slow_ping_ratio`` specifies a percentage of
  ``osd_heartbeat_grace`` to determine the threshold.  A value of zero
  disables the warning.  New configuration option
 ``mon_warn_on_slow_ping_time`` specified in milliseconds over-rides the
  computed value, causes a warning
  when OSD heartbeat pings take longer than the specified amount.
  New admin command ``ceph daemon mgr.# dump_osd_network [threshold]`` command will
  list all connections with a ping time longer than the specified threshold or
  value determined by the config options, for the average for any of the 3 intervals.
  New admin command ``ceph daemon osd.# dump_osd_network [threshold]`` will
  do the same but only including heartbeats initiated by the specified OSD.
