>=15.0.0
--------

* The RGW "num_rados_handles" has been removed.
  * If you were using a value of "num_rados_handles" greater than 1
    multiply your current "objecter_inflight_ops" and 
    "objecter_inflight_op_bytes" paramaeters by the old
    "num_rados_handles" to get the same throttle behavior.

* Ceph now packages python bindings for python3.6 instead of
  python3.4, because EPEL7 recently switched from python3.4 to
  python3.6 as the native python3. see the `announcement <https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/epel-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/EGUMKAIMPK2UD5VSHXM53BH2MBDGDWMO/>_`
  for more details on the background of this change.

* librbd now uses a write-around cache policy be default,
  replacing the previous write-back cache policy default.
  This cache policy allows librbd to immediately complete
  write IOs while they are still in-flight to the OSDs.
  Subsequent flush requests will ensure all in-flight
  write IOs are completed prior to completing. The
  librbd cache policy can be controlled via a new
  "rbd_cache_policy" configuration option.

* librbd now includes a simple IO scheduler which attempts to
  batch together multiple IOs against the same backing RBD
  data block object. The librbd IO scheduler policy can be
  controlled via a new "rbd_io_scheduler" configuration
  option.
