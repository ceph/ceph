* The 'mon_warn_osd_usage_min_max_delta' health warning has been disabled because
  it does not address clusters undergoing recovery or CRUSH rules that do
  not target all devices in the cluster.

* The OSDs now avoid starting new scrubs while recovery is in progress.  To
  revert to the old behavior (and do not let recovery activity affect the
  scrub scheduling) you can set the following option::

    osd scrub during recovery = true

-------

* The RBD C API's rbd_discard method and the C++ API's Image::discard method
  now enforce a maximum length of 2GB. This restriction prevents overflow of
  the result code.

* New OSDs will now use rocksdb for omap data by default, rather than
  leveldb. omap is used by RGW bucket indexes and CephFS directories,
  and when a single leveldb grows to 10s of GB with a high write or
  delete workload, it can lead to high latency when leveldb's
  single-threaded compaction cannot keep up. rocksdb supports multiple
  threads for compaction, which avoids this problem.
