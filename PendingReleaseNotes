  * 'USED_RAW' is now a sum of 'USED' space and space allocated/reserved at
     block device for Ceph purposes, e.g. BlueFS part for BlueStore.

* The 'ceph osd rm' command has been deprecated.  Users should use
  'ceph osd destroy' or 'ceph osd purge' (but after first confirming it is
  safe to do so via the 'ceph osd safe-to-destroy' command).

* The MDS now supports dropping its cache for the purposes of benchmarking.

    ceph tell mds.* cache drop <timeout>

  Note that the MDS cache is cooperatively managed by the clients. It is
  necessary for clients to give up capabilities in order for the MDS to fully
  drop its cache. This is accomplished by asking all clients to trim as many
  caps as possible. The timeout argument to the `cache drop` command controls
  how long the MDS waits for clients to complete trimming caps. This is optional
  and is 0 by default (no timeout). Keep in mind that clients may still retain
  caps to open files which will prevent the metadata for those files from being
  dropped by both the client and the MDS. (This is an equivalent scenario to
  dropping the Linux page/buffer/inode/dentry caches with some processes pinning
  some inodes/dentries/pages in cache.)

* The mon_health_preluminous_compat and mon_health_preluminous_compat_warning
  config options are removed, as the related functionality is more
  than two versions old.  Any legacy monitoring system expecting Jewel-style
  health output will need to be updated to work with Nautilus.

* Nautilus is not supported on any distros still running upstart so upstart
  specific files and references have been removed.

* The 'ceph pg <pgid> list_missing' command has been renamed to
  'ceph pg <pgid> list_unfound' to better match its behaviour.

* The 'rbd-mirror' daemon can now retrieve remote peer cluster configuration
  secrets from the monitor. To use this feature, the 'rbd-mirror' daemon
  CephX user for the local cluster must use the 'profile rbd-mirror' mon cap.
  The secrets can be set using the 'rbd mirror pool peer add' and
  'rbd mirror pool peer set' actions.

* The `ceph mds deactivate` is fully obsolete and references to it in the docs
  have been removed or clarified.

* The libcephfs bindings added the ceph_select_filesystem function
  for use with multiple filesystems.

* The cephfs python bindings now include mount_root and filesystem_name
  options in the mount() function.

* erasure-code: add experimental *Coupled LAYer (CLAY)* erasure codes
  support. It features less network traffic and disk I/O when performing
  recovery.

* The 'cache drop' OSD command has been added to drop an OSD's caches:

    - ``ceph tell osd.x cache drop``

* The 'cache status' OSD command has been added to get the cache stats of an
  OSD:

    - ``ceph tell osd.x cache status'

* The libcephfs added several functions that allow restarted client to destroy
  or reclaim state held by a previous incarnation. These functions are for NFS
  servers.

* The `ceph` command line tool now accepts keyword arguments in
  the format "--arg=value" or "--arg value".

* librados::IoCtx::nobjects_begin() and librados::NObjectIterator now communicate
  errors by throwing a std::system_error exception instead of std::runtime_error.

* the callback function passed to LibRGWFS.readdir() now accepts a ``flags``
  parameter. it will be the last parameter passed to  ``readdir()` method.

* The 'cephfs-data-scan scan_links' now automatically repair inotables and
  snaptable.

* Configuration values mon_warn_not_scrubbed/mon_warn_not_deep_scrubbed have been
  renamed.  They are now mon_warn_pg_not_scrubbed_ratio/mon_warn_pg_not_deep_scrubbed_ratio
  respectively.  This is to clarify that these warnings are related to pg scrubbing
  and are a ratio of the related interval.  These options are now enabled by default.

* The MDS cache trimming is now throttled. Dropping the MDS cache
  via the `ceph tell mds.<foo> cache drop` command or large reductions in the
  cache size will no longer cause service unavailability.

* The CephFS MDS behavior with recalling caps has been significantly improved
  to not attempt recalling too many caps at once, leading to instability.
  MDS with a large cache (64GB+) should be more stable.

* MDS now provides a config option "mds_max_caps_per_client" (default: 1M) to
  limit the number of caps a client session may hold. Long running client
  sessions with a large number of caps have been a source of instability in the
  MDS when all of these caps need to be processed during certain session
  events. It is recommended to not unnecessarily increase this value.

* The MDS config mds_recall_state_timeout has been removed. Late client recall
  warnings are now generated based on the number of caps the MDS has recalled
  which have not been released. The new configs mds_recall_warning_threshold
  (default: 32K) and mds_recall_warning_decay_rate (default: 60s) sets the
  threshold for this warning.

>=13.1.0
--------

* The Telegraf module for the Manager allows for sending statistics to
  an Telegraf Agent over TCP, UDP or a UNIX Socket. Telegraf can then
  send the statistics to databases like InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, Graphite
  and many more.

* The graylog fields naming the originator of a log event have
  changed: the string-form name is now included (e.g., ``"name":
  "mgr.foo"``), and the rank-form name is now in a nested section
  (e.g., ``"rank": {"type": "mgr", "num": 43243}``).

* If the cluster log is directed at syslog, the entries are now
  prefixed by both the string-form name and the rank-form name (e.g.,
  ``mgr.x mgr.12345 ...`` instead of just ``mgr.12345 ...``).

* The JSON output of the ``osd find`` command has replaced the ``ip``
  field with an ``addrs`` section to reflect that OSDs may bind to
  multiple addresses.

* CephFS clients without the 's' flag in their authentication capability
  string will no longer be able to create/delete snapshots. To allow
  ``client.foo`` to create/delete snapshots in the ``bar`` directory of
  filesystem ``cephfs_a``, use command:

    - ``ceph auth caps client.foo mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw tag cephfs data=cephfs_a' mds 'allow rw, allow rws path=/bar'``

* The ``osd_heartbeat_addr`` option has been removed as it served no
  (good) purpose: the OSD should always check heartbeats on both the
  public and cluster networks.

* The ``rados`` tool's ``mkpool`` and ``rmpool`` commands have been
  removed because they are redundant; please use the ``ceph osd pool
  create`` and ``ceph osd pool rm`` commands instead.

* The ``auid`` property for cephx users and RADOS pools has been
  removed.  This was an undocumented and partially implemented
  capability that allowed cephx users to map capabilities to RADOS
  pools that they "owned".  Because there are no users we have removed
  this support.  If any cephx capabilities exist in the cluster that
  restrict based on auid then they will no longer parse, and the
  cluster will report a health warning like::

    AUTH_BAD_CAPS 1 auth entities have invalid capabilities
        client.bad osd capability parse failed, stopped at 'allow rwx auid 123' of 'allow rwx auid 123'

  The capability can be adjusted with the ``ceph auth caps`` command. For example,::

    ceph auth caps client.bad osd 'allow rwx pool foo'

* The ``ceph-kvstore-tool`` ``repair`` command has been renamed
  ``destructive-repair`` since we have discovered it can corrupt an
  otherwise healthy rocksdb database.  It should be used only as a last-ditch
  attempt to recover data from an otherwise corrupted store.


* The default memory utilization for the mons has been increased
  somewhat.  Rocksdb now uses 512 MB of RAM by default, which should
  be sufficient for small to medium-sized clusters; large clusters
  should tune this up.  Also, the ``mon_osd_cache_size`` has been
  increase from 10 OSDMaps to 500, which will translate to an
  additional 500 MB to 1 GB of RAM for large clusters, and much less
  for small clusters.

* The ``mgr/balancer/max_misplaced`` option has been replaced by a new
  global ``target_max_misplaced_ratio`` option that throttles both
  balancer activity and automated adjustments to ``pgp_num`` (normally as a
  result of ``pg_num`` changes).  If you have customized the balancer module
  option, you will need to adjust your config to set the new global option
  or revert to the default of .05 (5%).

* By default, Ceph no longer issues a health warning when there are
  misplaced objects (objects that are fully replicated but not stored
  on the intended OSDs).  You can reenable the old warning by setting
  ``mon_warn_on_misplaced`` to ``true``.

* The ``ceph-create-keys`` tool is now obsolete.  The monitors
  automatically create these keys on their own.  For now the script
  prints a warning message and exits, but it will be removed in the
  next release.  Note that ``ceph-create-keys`` would also write the
  admin and bootstrap keys to /etc/ceph and /var/lib/ceph, but this
  script no longer does that.  Any deployment tools that relied on
  this behavior should instead make use of the ``ceph auth export
  <entity-name>`` command for whichever key(s) they need.

* The ``mon_osd_pool_ec_fast_read`` option has been renamed
  ``osd_pool_default_ec_fast_read`` to be more consistent with other
  ``osd_pool_default_*`` options that affect default values for newly
  created RADOS pools.

* The ``mon addr`` configuration option is now deprecated.  It can
  still be used to specify an address for each monitor in the
  ``ceph.conf`` file, but it only affects cluster creation and
  bootstrapping, and it does not support listing multiple addresses
  (e.g., both a v2 and v1 protocol address).  We strongly recommend
  the option be removed and instead a single ``mon host`` option be
  specified in the ``[global]`` section to allow daemons and clients
  to discover the monitors.

* New command `fs fail` has been added to quickly bring down a file
  system. This is a single command that unsets the joinable flag on the file
  system and brings down all of its ranks.

* The `cache drop` admin socket command has been removed. The `ceph tell mds.X
  cache drop` remains.

Upgrading from Luminous
-----------------------

* During the upgrade from luminous to nautilus, it will not be possible to create
  a new OSD using a luminous ceph-osd daemon after the monitors have been
  upgraded to nautilus.
