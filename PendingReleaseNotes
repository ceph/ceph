v0.84
-----

* The *_kb perf counters on the monitor have been removed.  These are
  replaced with a new set of *_bytes counters (e.g., cluster_osd_kb is
  replaced by cluster_osd_bytes).

* The rd_kb and wr_kb fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed via
  the 'ceph df detail -f json-pretty' and related commands) have been replaced
  with corresponding *_bytes fields.  Similarly, the 'total_space', 'total_used',
  and 'total_avail' fields are replaced with 'total_bytes', 'total_used_bytes',
  and 'total_avail_bytes' fields.
