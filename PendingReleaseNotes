>= 12.1.2
---------

* Added new commands "pg force-recovery" and "pg-force-backfill". Use them
  to boost recovery or backfill priority of specified pgs, so they're
  recovered/backfilled before any other. Note that these commands don't
  interrupt ongoing recovery/backfill, but merely queue specified pgs
  before others so they're recovered/backfilled as soon as possible.
  New commands "pg cancel-force-recovery" and "pg cancel-force-backfill"
  restore default recovery/backfill priority of previously forced pgs.

* A first release of Ceph for FreeBSD is available which contains a full 
  set of features, other than Bluestore. It will run everything needed to
  build a storage cluster. For clients, all access methods are available,
  albeit CephFS is only accessible through a Fuse implementation. RBD images 
  can be mounted on FreeBSD systems thru rbd-ggate

  Ceph versions are released thru the regular FreeBSD ports and packages
  system. The most current version is available as: net/ceph-devel. 
  Once Luminous goes into official release, this version will be available 
  as net/ceph. Future development releases will be available via net/ceph-devel

  More details about this port are in: README.FreeBSD
