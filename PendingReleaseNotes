>=14.2.2
--------

* Nautilus-based librbd clients can now open images on Jewel clusters.

* The RGW "num_rados_handles" has been removed.
  If you were using a value of "num_rados_handles" greater than 1
  multiply your current "objecter_inflight_ops" and
  "objecter_inflight_op_bytes" paramaeters by the old
  "num_rados_handles" to get the same throttle behavior.

14.2.2
------

* The no{up,down,in,out} related commands has been revamped.
  There are now 2 ways to set the no{up,down,in,out} flags:
  the old 'ceph osd [un]set <flag>' command, which sets cluster-wide flags;
  and the new 'ceph osd [un]set-group <flags> <who>' command,
  which sets flags in batch at the granularity of any crush node,
  or device class.

* RGW: radosgw-admin introduces two subcommands that allow the
  managing of expire-stale objects that might be left behind after a
  bucket reshard in earlier versions of RGW. One subcommand lists such
  objects and the other deletes them. Read the troubleshooting section
  of the dynamic resharding docs for details.

14.2.5
------

* The telemetry module now has a 'device' channel, enabled by default, that
  will report anonymized hard disk and SSD health metrics to telemetry.ceph.com
  in order to build and improve device failure prediction algorithms.  Because
  the content of telemetry reports has changed, you will need to either re-opt-in
  with::

    ceph telemetry on

  You can view exactly what information will be reported first with::

    ceph telemetry show
    ceph telemetry show device   # specifically show the device channel

  If you are not comfortable sharing device metrics, you can disable that
  channel first before re-opting-in:

    ceph config set mgr mgr/telemetry/channel_crash false
    ceph telemetry on

* The telemetry module now reports more information about CephFS file systems,
  including:

    - how many MDS daemons (in total and per file system)
    - which features are (or have been) enabled
    - how many data pools
    - approximate file system age (year + month of creation)
    - how many files, bytes, and snapshots
    - how much metadata is being cached

  We have also added:

    - which Ceph release the monitors are running
    - whether msgr v1 or v2 addresses are used for the monitors
    - whether IPv4 or IPv6 addresses are used for the monitors
    - whether RADOS cache tiering is enabled (and which mode)
    - whether pools are replicated or erasure coded, and
      which erasure code profile plugin and parameters are in use
    - how many hosts are in the cluster, and how many hosts have each type of daemon
    - whether a separate OSD cluster network is being used
    - how many RBD pools and images are in the cluster, and how many pools have RBD mirroring enabled
    - how many RGW daemons, zones, and zonegroups are present; which RGW frontends are in use
    - aggregate stats about the CRUSH map, like which algorithms are used, how big buckets are, how many rules are defined, and what tunables are in use

  If you had telemetry enabled, you will need to re-opt-in with::

    ceph telemetry on

  You can view exactly what information will be reported first with::

    ceph telemetry show        # see everything
    ceph telemetry show basic  # basic cluster info (including all of the new info)

* A health warning is now generated if the average osd heartbeat ping
  time exceeds a configurable threshold for any of the intervals
  computed.  The OSD computes 1 minute, 5 minute and 15 minute
  intervals with average, minimum and maximum values.  New configuration
  option ``mon_warn_on_slow_ping_ratio`` specifies a percentage of
  ``osd_heartbeat_grace`` to determine the threshold.  A value of zero
  disables the warning.  New configuration option
 ``mon_warn_on_slow_ping_time`` specified in milliseconds over-rides the
  computed value, causes a warning
  when OSD heartbeat pings take longer than the specified amount.
  New admin command ``ceph daemon mgr.# dump_osd_network [threshold]`` command will
  list all connections with a ping time longer than the specified threshold or
  value determined by the config options, for the average for any of the 3 intervals.
  New admin command ``ceph daemon osd.# dump_osd_network [threshold]`` will
  do the same but only including heartbeats initiated by the specified OSD.
