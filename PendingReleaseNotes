14.2.8
------

* The following OSD memory config options related to bluestore cache autotuning can now
  be configured during runtime:

    - osd_memory_base (default: 768 MB)
    - osd_memory_cache_min (default: 128 MB)
    - osd_memory_expected_fragmentation (default: 0.15)
    - osd_memory_target (default: 4 GB)

  The above options can be set with::

    ceph config set global <option> <value>

* The MGR now accepts 'profile rbd' and 'profile rbd-read-only' user caps.
  These caps can be used to provide users access to MGR-based RBD functionality
  such as 'rbd perf image iostat' an 'rbd perf image iotop'.

* The configuration value ``osd_calc_pg_upmaps_max_stddev`` used for upmap
  balancing has been removed. Instead use the mgr balancer config
  ``upmap_max_deviation`` which now is an integer number of PGs of deviation
  from the target PGs per OSD.  This can be set with a command like
  ``ceph config set mgr mgr/balancer/upmap_max_deviation 2``.  The default
  ``upmap_max_deviation`` is 5.  There are situations where crush rules
  would not allow a pool to ever have completely balanced PGs.  For example, if
  crush requires 1 replica on each of 3 racks, but there are fewer OSDs in 1 of
  the racks.  In those cases, the configuration value can be increased.

* RGW: a mismatch between the bucket notification documentation and the actual
  message format was fixed. This means that any endpoints receiving bucket 
  notification, will now receive the same notifications inside an JSON array
  named 'Records'. Note that this does not affect pulling bucket notification
  from a subscription in a 'pubsub' zone, as these are already wrapped inside
  that array.

* Ceph will now issue a health warning if a RADOS pool as a ``pg_num``
  value that is not a power of two.  This can be fixed by adjusting
  the pool to a nearby power of two::

    ceph osd pool set <pool-name> pg_num <new-pg-num>

  Alternatively, the warning can be silenced with::

    ceph config set global mon_warn_on_pool_pg_num_not_power_of_two false
