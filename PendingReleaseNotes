v0.65
-----

* Huge revamp of the 'ceph' command-line interface implementation.

* The 'ceph osd tell ...' and 'ceph mon tell ...' commands are no
  longer supported.  Any callers should use::

    ceph tell osd.<id or *> ...
    ceph tell mon.<id or name or *> ...

  The 'ceph mds tell ...' command is still there, but will soon also
  transition to 'ceph tell mds.<id or name or *> ...'

* The 'ceph osd crush add ...' command used to take one of two forms::

    ceph osd crush add 123 osd.123 <weight> <location ...>
    ceph osd crush add osd.123 <weight> <location ...>

  This is because the id and crush name are redundant.  Now only the
  simple form is supported, where the osd name/id can either be a bare
  id (integer) or name (osd.<id>)::

    ceph osd crush add osd.123 <weight> <location ...>
    ceph osd crush add 123 <weight> <location ...>
