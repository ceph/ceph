14.0.1
------

* The 'ceph osd rm' command has been deprecated.  Users should use
  'ceph osd destroy' or 'ceph osd purge' (but after first confirming it is
  safe to do so via the 'ceph osd safe-to-destroy' command).
* The mon_health_preluminous_compat and mon_health_preluminous_compat_warning
  config options are removed, as the related functionality is more
  than two versions old.  Any legacy monitoring system expecting Jewel-style
  health output will need to be updated to work with Nautilus.

* Nautilus is not supported on any distros still running upstart so upstart
  specific files and references have been removed.

* The 'ceph pg <pgid> list_missing' command has been renamed to
  'ceph pg <pgid> list_unfound' to better match its behaviour.

>=13.1.0
--------

* The Telegraf module for the Manager allows for sending statistics to
  an Telegraf Agent over TCP, UDP or a UNIX Socket. Telegraf can then
  send the statistics to databases like InfluxDB, ElasticSearch, Graphite
  and many more.

* The graylog fields naming the originator of a log event have
  changed: the string-form name is now included (e.g., ``"name":
  "mgr.foo"``), and the rank-form name is now in a nested section
  (e.g., ``"rank": {"type": "mgr", "num": 43243}``).

* If the cluster log is directed at syslog, the entries are now
  prefixed by both the string-form name and the rank-form name (e.g.,
  ``mgr.x mgr.12345 ...`` instead of just ``mgr.12345 ...``).

* The JSON output of the ``osd find`` command has replaced the ``ip``
  field with an ``addrs`` section to reflect that OSDs may bind to
  multiple addresses.

* CephFS clients without the 's' flag in their authentication capability
  string will no longer be able to create/delete snapshots. To allow
  ``client.foo`` to create/delete snapshots in the ``bar`` directory of
  filesystem ``cephfs_a``, use command:

    - ``ceph auth caps client.foo mon 'allow r' osd 'allow rw tag cephfs data=cephfs_a' mds 'allow rw, allow rws path=/bar'``

* The ``osd_heartbeat_addr`` option has been removed as it served no
  (good) purpose: the OSD should always check heartbeats on both the
  public and cluster networks.

* The ``rados`` tool's ``mkpool`` and ``rmpool`` commands have been
  removed because they are redundant; please use the ``ceph osd pool
  create`` and ``ceph osd pool rm`` commands instead.

* The ``auid`` property for cephx users and RADOS pools has been
  removed.  This was an undocumented and partially implemented
  capability that allowed cephx users to map capabilities to RADOS
  pools that they "owned".  Because there are no users we have removed
  this support.  If any cephx capabilities exist in the cluster that
  restrict based on auid then they will no longer parse, and the
  cluster will report a health warning like::

    AUTH_BAD_CAPS 1 auth entities have invalid capabilities
        client.bad osd capability parse failed, stopped at 'allow rwx auid 123' of 'allow rwx auid 123'

  The capability can be adjusted with the ``ceph auth caps`` command. For example,::

    ceph auth caps client.bad osd 'allow rwx pool foo'






Upgrading from Luminous
-----------------------

* During the upgrade from luminous to nautilus, it will not be possible to create
  a new OSD using a luminous ceph-osd daemon after the monitors have been
  upgraded to nautilus.
