13.0.1
------

* *CephFS*:

  * Several "ceph mds" commands have been obsoleted and replaced
    by equivalent "ceph fs" commands:
      - mds dump -> fs dump
      - mds getmap -> fs dump
      - mds stop -> mds deactivate
      - mds set_max_mds -> fs set max_mds
      - mds set -> fs set
      - mds cluster_down -> fs set cluster_down true
      - mds cluster_up -> fs set cluster_down false
      - mds add_data_pool -> fs add_data_pool
      - mds remove_data_pool -> fs rm_data_pool
      - mds rm_data_pool -> fs rm_data_pool

  * New CephFS file system attributes session_timeout and session_autoclose
    are configurable via `ceph fs set`. The MDS config options
    mds_session_timeout, mds_session_autoclose, and mds_max_file_size are now
    obsolete.

* *RBD*

  * The RBD C API's rbd_discard method now enforces a maximum length of
    2GB to match the C++ API's Image::discard method. This restriction
    prevents overflow of the result code.

  * The rbd CLI's "lock list" JSON and XML output has changed.

  * The rbd CLI's "showmapped" JSON and XML output has changed.

* The sample ``crush-location-hook`` script has been removed.  Its output is
  equivalent to the built-in default behavior, so it has been replaced with an
  example in the CRUSH documentation.

* The "rcceph" script (systemd/ceph in the source code tree, shipped as
  /usr/sbin/rcceph in the ceph-base package for CentOS and SUSE) has been
  dropped. This script was used to perform admin operations (start, stop,
  restart, etc.) on all OSD and/or MON daemons running on a given machine.
  This functionality is provided by the systemd target units (ceph-osd.target,
  ceph-mon.target, etc.).


>= 12.2.2
---------

- *CephFS*:

  * The CephFS client now catches failures to clear dentries during startup
    and refuses to start as consistency and untrimmable cache issues may
    develop. The new option client_die_on_failed_dentry_invalidate (default:
    true) may be turned off to allow the client to proceed (dangerous!).
