 OS Recommendations
====================

Ceph Dependencies
=================

As a general rule, we recommend deploying Ceph on newer releases of Linux. 
We also recommend deploying on releases with long-term support.

Linux Kernel
------------

- **Ceph Kernel Client**

  If you are using the kernel client to map RBD block devices or mount
  CephFS, the general advice is to use a "stable" or "longterm
  maintenance" kernel series provided by either http://kernel.org or
  your Linux distribution on any client hosts.

  For RBD, if you choose to *track* long-term kernels, we recommend
  *at least* 4.19-based "longterm maintenance" kernel series.  If you can
  use a newer "stable" or "longterm maintenance" kernel series, do it.

  For CephFS, see the section about `Mounting CephFS using Kernel Driver`_
  for kernel version guidance.

  Older kernel client versions may not support your `CRUSH tunables`_ profile
  or other newer features of the Ceph cluster, requiring the storage cluster to
  be configured with those features disabled. For RBD, a kernel of version 5.3
  or CentOS 8.2 is the minimum necessary for reasonable support for RBD image
  features.


Platforms
=========

The chart below shows which Linux platforms Ceph provides packages for, and
which platforms Ceph has been tested on. 

Ceph does not require a specific Linux distribution. Ceph can run on any
distribution that includes a supported kernel and supported system startup
framework, for example ``sysvinit`` or ``systemd``. Ceph is sometimes ported to
non-Linux systems but these are not supported by the core Ceph effort.

- **A**: Ceph provides packages and has done comprehensive tests on the software in them.
- **B**: Ceph provides packages and has done basic tests on the software in them.
- **C**: Ceph provides packages only. No tests have been done on these releases.
- **H**: Ceph tests this distribution as a container host.
- **1**: Testing has been done on Centos 9 starting on version 17.2.8 for Quincy.

.. note::
   **For Centos 7 Users** 
   
   ``Btrfs`` is no longer tested on Centos 7 in the Octopus release. We recommend using ``bluestore`` instead.

.. note:: See the list of QAed container hosts in the Ceph repository here:
   `List of Container Hosts
   <https://github.com/ceph/ceph/tree/main/qa/distros/supported-container-hosts>`_.
