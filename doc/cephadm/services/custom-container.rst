Custom Container Service
========================

The orchestrator enables custom containers to be deployed using a YAML file.
A corresponding :ref:`orchestrator-cli-service-spec` must look like:

.. code-block:: yaml

    service_type: container
    service_id: foo
    placement:
        ...
    image: docker.io/library/foo:latest
    entrypoint: /usr/bin/foo
    uid: 1000
    gid: 1000
    args:
        - "--net=host"
        - "--cpus=2"
    ports:
        - 8080
        - 8443
    envs:
        - SECRET=mypassword
        - PORT=8080
        - PUID=1000
        - PGID=1000
    volume_mounts:
        CONFIG_DIR: /etc/foo
    bind_mounts:
      - ['type=bind', 'source=lib/modules', 'destination=/lib/modules', 'ro=true']
    dirs:
      - CONFIG_DIR
    files:
      CONFIG_DIR/foo.conf:
        - refresh=true
        - username=xyz
        - "port: 1234"

where the properties of a service specification are:

* ``service_id``
    A unique name of the service.
* ``image``
    The name of the Docker image.
* ``uid``
    The UID to use when creating directories and files in the host system.
* ``gid``
    The GID to use when creating directories and files in the host system.
* ``entrypoint``
    Overwrite the default ENTRYPOINT of the image.
* ``args``
    A list of additional Podman/Docker command line arguments.
* ``ports``
    A list of TCP ports to open in the host firewall.
* ``envs``
    A list of environment variables.
* ``bind_mounts``
    When you use a bind mount, a file or directory on the host machine
    is mounted into the container. Relative `source=...` paths will be
    located below `/var/lib/ceph/<cluster-fsid>/<daemon-name>`.
* ``volume_mounts``
    When you use a volume mount, a new directory is created within
    Docker’s storage directory on the host machine, and Docker manages
    that directory’s contents. Relative source paths will be located below
    `/var/lib/ceph/<cluster-fsid>/<daemon-name>`.
* ``dirs``
    A list of directories that are created below
    `/var/lib/ceph/<cluster-fsid>/<daemon-name>`.
* ``files``
    A dictionary, where the key is the relative path of the file and the
    value the file content. The content must be double quoted when using
    a string. Use '\\n' for line breaks in that case. Otherwise define
    multi-line content as list of strings. The given files will be created
    below the directory `/var/lib/ceph/<cluster-fsid>/<daemon-name>`.
    The absolute path of the directory where the file will be created must
    exist. Use the `dirs` property to create them if necessary.
