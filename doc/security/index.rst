* Please do not file a public ceph tracker issue for a vulnerability.
* We urge reporters to provide as much information as is practicable
  (a reproducer, versions affected, fix if available, etc.), as this
  can speed up the process considerably.
* Please let us know to whom credit should be given and with what
  affiliations.
* If this issue is not yet disclosed publicly and you have any
  disclosure date in mind, please share the same along with the
  report.
