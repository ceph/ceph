    The move is necessary because jewel-specific changes are needed, yet teuthology
    does not maintain a separate branch for jewel. Also, swift.py is a
    Ceph-specific task so it makes more sense to have it in Ceph.

    tests: rados: sleep before ceph tell osd.0 flush_pg_stats after restart
    
    Even though we wait for HEALTH_OK after restarting the daemons, they are not
    ready to respond to flush_pg_stats.
    
    The reason why the osd is not ready for "tell" command after "ceph health"
    shows that the cluster is "HEALTH_OK" is that the monitor fails to be notified
    that the osd in question is not up in "heatbeat_interval". Because infernalis
    does not have the osd_fast_fail_on_connection_refused support, the monitor
    needs longer to detect that an osd is down, and osd_heartbeat_grace is used to
    determine if an osd is down.

    client: update the 'approaching max_size' code
    
    The old 'approaching max_size' code expects MDS set max_size to
    '2 x reported_size'. This is no longer true. The new code reports
    file size when half of previous max_size increment has been used.

    mds: limit client writable range increment
    
    For very large file, setting the writable range to '2 * file_size'
    causes file recovery to run a long time. To recover a 1T file, Filer
    needs to probe 2T~1T range.

    osdc/Journaler: avoid executing on_safe contexts prematurely
    
    Journaler::_do_flush() can skip flushing some data when prezered
    journal space isn't enough. Before updating Journaler::next_safe_pos,
    we need to check if Journaler::_do_flush() has flushed enough data.

    Clearly this extra round trip has a cost, but reads of

    cls/rgw: list_plain_entries() stops before bi_log entries
    
    list_plain_entries() was using encode_obj_versioned_data_key() to set
    its end_key, which gives a prefix of BI_BUCKET_OBJ_INSTANCE_INDEX[=2]
    
    that range between start_key and end_key would not only span the
    BI_BUCKET_OBJS_INDEX[=0] prefixes, but BI_BUCKET_LOG_INDEX[=1] prefixes
    as well. this can result in list_plain_entries() trying and failing to
    decode a rgw_bi_log_entry as a rgw_bucket_dir_entry

    The file open flags (O_foo) are platform specific. Normalize these flags
    before they are send to the MDS. For processing of client messages the
    MDS should only compare to these normalized flags.
    Otherwise this can lead to bogus flags getting transmitted on ppc64.

    Add repair command to ceph-osdomap-tool too
    
    Under some situations the previous rm_keys() code would
    generated a corrupt complete table.  There is no way to
    figure out what the table should look like now.  By removing
    the entries we fix the corruption and aren't much worse off
    because the corruption caused some deleted keys to re-appear.
    
    This doesn't breaking the parent/child relationship during
    repair because some of the keys may still be contained
    in the parent.

    Previously, in_complete_region didn't guarantee anything about
    where it left complete_iter pointing.  It will be handy for
    complete_iter to be pointing at the lowest interval which ends
    after to_test.  Make it so.

    DBObjectMap: fix next_parent()
    
    The previous implementation assumed that
    lower_bound(parent_iter->key()) always leaves the iterator
    on_parent().  There isn't any guarantee, however, that that
    key isn't present on the child as well.

    rgw: add suport for creating S3 type subuser of admin rest api
    
    Fixes: http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/16682
    
    The original code cannot support create s3 type subuser of admin rest api as when i execute the following command:
    
      ./s3curl.pl --id=personal --put -- http://radosgw.h3c.com:8000/admin/user?subuser\&uid=yrf2\&subuser=yrf2:yrf1\&key-type=s3 -v
    
    it would return msg as follows :

    rgw: swift: disable revocation thread if sleep == 0 || cache_size == 0
    
    Keystone tokens can be revoked.  This causes them to fail
    validation.  However, in ceph, we cache them.  As long as
    they're in the cache we trust them.  To find revoked tokens
    there's a call OSI-PKI/revoked but that's only useful for
    pki tokens.  Installations using fernet/uuid may not even
    have the proper credentials to support the call, in which
    case the call blows up in various ways filling up logs
    with complaints.
    
    This code makes the revocation thread optional; by disabling it,
    the complaints go away.  A further fix is in the works
    to use other more modern calls available in modern keystone
    installations to properly deal with non-PKI/PKIZ tokens.
    
    (NB: jewel has this logic in src/rgw/rgw_swift.cc not in src/rgw/rgw_keystone.h)
    
    To disable the revocation thread, use at least one of these:
            rgw_keystone_token_cache_size = 0
                    using this will cause tokens to be validated on every call.
    You may instead want to set
            rgw_keystone_revocation_interval = 0
                    using just this will disable the revocation thread,
                    but leaves the cache in use.  That avoids the extra
                    validation overhead, but means token revocation won't
                    work very well.

    rgw: add bucket size limit check to radosgw-admin
    
    The change adds a new list of all buckets x all users, with
    fields for bucket name, tenant name, current num_objects,
    current num_shards, current objects per shard, and the
    corresponding fill_status--the latter consisting of 'OK',
    'WARN <n>%', or 'OVER <n>%.'
    
    The warning check is relative to two new tunables.  The threshold
    max objects per shard is set as rgw_bucket_safe_max_objects_per_shard,
    which defaults to 100K.  The value rgw_bucket_warning_threshold is
    a percent of the current safe max at which to warn (defaults to
    90% of full).
    
    From review:
    
    * fix indentation (rgw_admin)
    * if user a user_id is provided, check only buckets for that user
    * update shard warn pct to be pct-of-fill (not 100 - pct-of-fill)
    * print only buckets near or over per-shard limit, if --warnings-only
    * s/bucket limitcheck/bucket limit check */
    * sanity shard limit should be 90, not 10 (because that changed)
    * fixes for memleaks and other points found by cbodley

    common,test: g_ceph_context->put() upon return
    
    prior to this change, global_init() could create a new CephContext
    and assign it to g_ceph_context. it's our responsibilty to release
    the CephContext explicitly using cct->put() before the application
    quits. but sometimes, we fail to do so.
    
    in this change, global_init() will return an intrusive_ptr<CephContext>,
    which calls `g_ceph_context->put()` in its dtor. this ensures that
    the CephContext is always destroyed before main() returns. so the
    log is flushed before _log_exp_length is destroyed.
    
    there are two cases where global_pre_init() is called directly.
    - ceph_conf.cc: g_ceph_context->put() will be called by an intrusive_ptr<>
      deleter.
    - rgw_main.cc: global_init() is called later on on the success code
      path, so it will be taken care of.

    ceph-disk: dmcrypt activate must use the same cluster as prepare
    
    When dmcrypt is used, the fsid cannot be retrieved from the data
    partition because it is encrypted. Store the fsid in the lockbox to
    enable dmcrypt activation using the same logic as regular activation.
    
    The fsid is used to retrive the cluster name that was used during
    prepare, reason why activation does not and must not have a --cluster
    argument.

    cephfs: fix mount point break off problem after mds switch occured
    
    The hot-standby become active as we expected but the mount piont broken strangely
    when the active mds is down. The root reason is the new mds use last_cap_renews
    decoded from ESesson::replay in find_idle_sessions and wrongly killed the session.
    Maybe we should reset session->last_cap_renew to the current time when server send
    OPEN to client in reconnect stage.

    cephfs: fix write_buf's _len overflow problem
    
    After I have set about 400 64KB xattr kv pair to a file,
    mds is crashed. Every time I try to start mds, it will crash again.
    The root reason is write_buf._len overflowed when doing
    Journaler::append_entry().
    
    This patch try to fix this problem through the following changes:
    
     1. limit file/dir's xattr size
     2. throttle journal entry append operations

    tools/cephfs: set dir_layout when injecting inodes
    
    When we left this as zero, the MDS would interpret it was HASH_LINUX
    rather than the default HASH_RJENKINS.  Potentially that
    could cause problems if there perhaps were already dirfrags in
    the metadata pool that were set up using rjenkins.  Mainly
    it just seems more appropriate to explicitly set this field
    rather than hit the fallback behaviour.

    ceph-disk: enable directory backed OSD at boot time
    
    https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/539385b143feee3905dceaf7a8faaced42f2d3c6
    introduced a regression preventing directory backed OSD from starting at
    boot time.
    
    For device backed OSD the boot sequence starts with ceph-disk@.service
    and proceeds to
    
        systemctl enable --runtime ceph-osd@.service
    
    where the --runtime ensure ceph-osd@12 is removed when the machine
    reboots so that it does not compete with the ceph-disk@/dev/sdb1 unit at
    boot time.
    
    However directory backed OSD solely rely on the ceph-osd@.service unit
    to start at boot time and will therefore fail to boot.
    
    The --runtime flag is selectively set for device backed OSD only.

    osd/ReplicatedPG: limit the number of concurrently trimming pgs
    
    This patch introduces an AsyncReserver for snap trimming to limit the
    number of pgs on any single OSD which can be trimming, as with backfill.
    Unlike backfill, we don't take remote reservations on the assumption
    that the set of pgs with trimming work to do is already well
    distributed, so it doesn't seem worth the implementation overhead to get
    reservations from the peers as well.

    osdc/Objecter: resend RWORDERED ops on full
    
    Our condition for respecting the FULL flag is complex, and involves
    the WRITE | RWORDERED flags vs the FULL_FORCE | FULL_TRY flags.  Previously,
    we could block a read bc of RWORDRED but not resend it later.
    
    Fix by capturing the complex condition in a respects_full() bool and using
    it both for the blocking-on-send and resending-on-possibly-notfull-later
    checks.

    debian: replace SysV rbdmap with systemd service
    
    Stop shipping /etc/init.d/rbdmap in the Debian packages. Ship the
    rbdmap.service systemd unit file instead.
    
    The corresponding change has already been made for RPMs, in
    9224ac2ad25f7d017916f58b642c0ea25305c3e5.
    
    For Upstart-based systems (eg Ubuntu Trusty), the Debian packages
    already contain rbdmap.conf.

    script from our tree entirely.)

    ceph-disk: Adding retry loop in get_partition_dev()
    
    There is very rare cases where get_partition_dev() is called before the actual partition is available in /sys/block/<device>.
    
    It appear that waiting a very short is usually enough to get the partition beein populated.
    
    Analysis:
    update_partition() is supposed to be enough to avoid any racing between events sent by parted/sgdisk/partprobe and
    the actual creation on the /sys/block/<device>/* entrypoint.
    On our CI that race occurs pretty often but trying to reproduce it locally never been possible.
    
    This patch is almost a workaround rather than a fix to the real problem.
    It offer retrying after a very short to be make a chance the device to appear.
    This approach have been succesful on the CI.
    
    Note his patch is not changing the timing when the device is perfectly created on time and just differ by a 1/5th up to 2 seconds when the bug occurs.
    
    A typical output from the build running on a CI with that code.

    rbdmap: unmap RBDMAPFILE images unless called with unmap-all
    
    When called with a "map" parameter, the rbdmap script iterates the list
    of images present in RBDMAPFILE (/etc/ceph/rbdmap), and maps each entry.
    When called with "unmap", rbdmap currently iterates *all* mapped RBD
    images and unmaps each one, regardless of whether it's listed in the
    RBDMAPFILE or not.
    
    This commit adds functionality such that only RBD images listed in the
    configuration file are unmapped. This behaviour is the new default for
    "rbdmap unmap". A new "unmap-all" parameter is added to offer the old
    unmap-all-rbd-images behaviour, which is used by the systemd service.

    rgw: fix break inside of yield in RGWFetchAllMetaCR
    
    the yield macro is implemented with for/switch, so the breaks in
    RGWFetchAllMetaCR weren't being applied to the for loop as expected -
    so any of these breaks send RGWFetchAllMetaCR into an infinite loop
    
    removed the yield {} block, so that breaks will apply to the for loop as
    intended, then added a single yield; statement to allow the
    entries_index consumer to run one per iteration

    jewel: osd/PGLog: reindex properly on pg log split
    
    When PGLog::IndexedLog::split_into runs it builds the list, which means
    the old indices are wrong (point to bad memory), but index() will not
    rebuild them because ever since b858e86 we won't rebuild them if they
    are already built. Fix that by calling unindex() before the split.
    
    Based on 643ae42cf27f16dd6ed4e1402acc0483bb9fca74. Notice that both
    the child and the parent log are re-indexed in Jewel, so the only
    problem is missing unindex().

    osd/OSDMap: don't set weight to IN when OSD is destroyed
    
    Since commit 4e28f9e63644 ("osd/OSDMap: clear osd_info, osd_xinfo on
    osd deletion"), weight is set to IN when OSD is deleted.  This changes
    the result of applying an incremental for clients, not just OSDs.
    Because CRUSH computations are obviously affected, pre-4e28f9e63644
    servers disagree with post-4e28f9e63644 clients on object placement,
    resulting in misdirected requests.

    systemd: Start OSDs after MONs
    
    Currently, we start/stop OSDs and MONs simultaneously. This may cause
    problems especially when we are shutting down the system. Once the mon
    goes down it causes a re-election and the MONs can miss the message
    from the OSD that is going down.

    tests: Thrasher: eliminate a race between kill_osd and __init__
    
    If Thrasher.__init__() spawns the do_thrash thread before initializing the
    ceph_objectstore_tool property, do_thrash races with the rest
    of Thrasher.__init__() and in some cases do_thrash can call kill_osd() before
    Trasher.__init__() progresses much further. This can lead to an exception
    ("AttributeError: Thrasher instance has no attribute 'ceph_objectstore_tool'")
    being thrown in kill_osd().
    
    This commit eliminates the race by making sure the ceph_objectstore_tool
    attribute is initialized before the do_thrash thread is spawned.

    osd/PG: restrict want_acting to up+acting on recovery completion
    
    On recovery completion we recalculate want_acting to see if we
    should add recently backfilled osds into acting.  However, at
    this point we may have gotten infos from others OSDs outside
    of up/acting that could be used for want_acting.  We currently
    assert that only up/acting osds are used in
    PG::RecoveryState::Active::react(const AdvMap&), so we must
    restrict want_acting to up/acting here.
    
    We could remove this restriction, but it would mean
    
    1) checking on every map change that want_acting hasn't been
    invalidated, and if so, recalculating want_acting and requesting
    a new pg_temp.  Also, presumably
    
    2) on each new info, checking whether we can construct a better
    want_acting, and if so, doing it.
    
    That would be a good thing, but is a more complicated change.  In
    reality this case comes up very rarely, so simply make our
    post-recovery want_acting calculation limit itself to up+acting.
    
    See 1db67c443d84dc5d1ff53cc820fdfd4a2128b680 for the assertion.

    rgw tests: clean up immediately after the test
    
    There's no need for an explicit cleanup function, so move it back
    to where it came from (except in s3roundtrip, which did not have it).
    
    Instead, since these use a nested contextmanager, pass through
    and yield to the top-level run_tasks after the nested
    contextmanager has finished (and thus run all the cleanup steps
    in the subtasks for this test).

    Replace /tmp/cephtest/ with configurable path
    
    Teuthology uses /tmp/cephtest/ as the scratch test directory for
    a run.  This patch replaces /tmp/cephtest/ everywhere with a
    per-run directory: {basedir}/{rundir} where {basedir} is a directory
    configured in .teuthology.yaml (/tmp/cephtest if not specified),
    and {rundir} is the name of the run, as given in --name.  If no name
    is specified, {user}-{timestamp} is used.
    
    To get the old behavior (/tmp/cephtest), set test_path: /tmp/cephtest
    in .teuthology.yaml.
    
    This change was modivated by #3782, which requires a test dir that
    survives across reboots, but also resolves #3767.
