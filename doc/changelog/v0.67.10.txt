    Add rbdcache max dirty object option
    
    Librbd will calculate max dirty object according to rbd_cache_max_size, it
    doesn't suitable for every case. If user set image order 24, the calculating
    result is too small for reality. It will increase the overhead of trim call
    which is called each read/write op.
    
    Now we make it as option for tunning, by default this value is calculated.

    librbd/internal.cc: check earlier for null pointer
    
    Fix potential null ponter deref, move check for 'order != NULL'
    to the beginning of the function to prevent a) deref in ldout() call
    and b) to leave function as early as possible if check fails.
    
    [src/librbd/internal.cc:843] -> [src/librbd/internal.cc:865]: (warning)
     Possible null pointer dereference: order - otherwise it is redundant
     to check it against null.

    os/FileStore: force any new xattr into omap on E2BIG
    
    If we have a huge xattr (or many little ones), the _fgetattrs() for the
    inline_set will fail with E2BIG.  The conditions later where we decide
    whether to clean up the old xattr will then also fail.  Will *will* put
    the xattr in omap, but the non-omap version isn't cleaned up.
    
    Fix this by setting a flag if we get E2BIG that the inline_set is known
    to be incomplete.  In that case, take the conservative step of assuming
    the xattr might be present and chain_fremovexattr().  Ignore any error
    because it might not be there.
    
    This is clearly harmless in the general case because it won't be there.  If
    it is, we will hopefully remove enough xattrs that the E2BIG condition
    will go away (usually by removing some really big chained xattr).
    
    See bug #7779.

    osd: introduce simple sleep during scrub
    
    This option is similar to osd_snap_trim_sleep: simply inject an optional
    sleep in the thread that is doing scrub work.  This is a very kludgey and
    coarse knob for limiting the impact of scrub on the cluster, but can help
    until we have a more robust and elegant solution.
    
    Only sleep if we are in the NEW_CHUNK state to avoid delaying processing of
    an in-progress chunk.  In this state nothing is blocked on anything.
    Conveniently, chunky_scrub() requeues itself for each new chunk.

    Implement CrushWrapper::ruleset_exists that iterates over the existing
    rulesets to find the one matching the ruleset argument.
    
    ceph osd pool set <pool> crush_ruleset must not use
    CrushWrapper::rule_exists, which checks for a *rule* existing, whereas
    the value being set is a *ruleset*. (cherry picked from commit

    A test via ceph osd pool set data crush_ruleset verifies the ruleset
    argument is accepted.

    rgw: cut short object read if a chunk returns error
    
    Fixes: #8289
    Backport: firefly, dumpling
    When reading an object, if we hit an error when trying to read one of
    the rados objects then we should just stop. Otherwise we're just going
    to continue reading the rest of the object, and since it can't be sent
    back to the client (as we have a hole in the middle), we end up
    accumulating everything in memory.

    rgw: don't allow multiple writers to same multiobject part
    
    Fixes: #8269
    
    A client might need to retry a multipart part write. The original thread
    might race with the new one, trying to clean up after it, clobbering the
    part's data.
    The fix is to detect whether an original part already existed, and if so
    use a different part name for it.
