    osd: shutdown our reserver_finisher earlier in the process

    This finisher thread has a lot of callbacks which can hold PGRefs. Make
    sure we drain them out before checking that all the PGs have finished
    and have no outstanding references.

    Moving this should be safe; we've already stopped the op thread et al
    and the only things still running are the OSDService's objecter_finisher,
    recovery_request_timer, and snap_sleep_timer (which has definitely been emptied
    by the time we get here as it's synchronously cleared out on PG shutdown).

    do not issue caps immediately. Let CInode::encode_inodestate()
    do the job instead. This can avoid various races that early reply
    is not allowed, caps that haven't been sent to client gets revoked.

    rgw: make a configurable size for requests with xml params

    We currently read all user input for a few apis accepting xml, avoid
    doing this and error out early, most s3 apis limit to about 1000 xml
    entries, make this configurable via a new config param,
    `rgw_max_put_param_size` defaulting to 1MB. Also modified
    `rgw_rest_read_all_input` with an additional param to not allow for
    chunked uploads, though we error out in a better way by responding with
    content length required rather than S3's 501 if chunked is set.

    This also adds the same behavior in RGWPutCORS reusing
    `rgw_rest_read_all_input`, and using a data_deleter to manage the char*

    e.g, when i use s3cmd do copy object(bucket_A/obj_A -> bucket_B/obj_B, assume the size of obj_A is 4M).
    then i use s3cmd do list bucket, I got obj_B size is 512K, it is the head size apparently.

    rgw: swift: disable revocation thread if sleep == 0 || cache_size == 0

    Keystone tokens can be revoked.  This causes them to fail
    validation.  However, in ceph, we cache them.  As long as
    they're in the cache we trust them.  To find revoked tokens
    there's a call OSI-PKI/revoked but that's only useful for
    pki tokens.  Installations using fernet/uuid may not even
    have the proper credentials to support the call, in which
    case the call blows up in various ways filling up logs
    with complaints.

    This code makes the revocation thread optional; by disabling it,
    the complaints go away.  A further fix is in the works
    to use other more modern calls available in modern keystone
    installations to properly deal with non-PKI/PKIZ tokens.

    To disable the revocation thread, use at least one of these:
            rgw_keystone_token_cache_size = 0
                    using this will cause tokens to be validated on every call.
    You may instead want to set
            rgw_keystone_revocation_interval = 0
                    using just this will disable the revocation thread,
                    but leaves the cache in use.  That avoids the extra
                    validation overhead, but means token revocation won't
                    work very well.

    ceph-disk: Adding retry loop in get_partition_dev()

    There is very rare cases where get_partition_dev() is called before the actual partition is available in /sys/block/<device>.

    It appear that waiting a very short is usually enough to get the partition beein populated.

    Analysis:
    update_partition() is supposed to be enough to avoid any racing between events sent by parted/sgdisk/partprobe and
    the actual creation on the /sys/block/<device>/* entrypoint.
    On our CI that race occurs pretty often but trying to reproduce it locally never been possible.

    This patch is almost a workaround rather than a fix to the real problem.
    It offer retrying after a very short to be make a chance the device to appear.
    This approach have been succesful on the CI.

    Note his patch is not changing the timing when the device is perfectly created on time and just differ by a 1/5th up to 2 seconds when the bug occurs.

    A typical output from the build running on a CI with that code.
            command_check_call: Running command: /usr/bin/udevadm settle --timeout=600

    ceph-disk: Reporting /sys directory in get_partition_dev()

    When get_partition_dev() fails, it reports the following message :
        ceph_disk.main.Error: Error: partition 2 for /dev/sdb does not appear to exist
    The code search for a directory inside the /sys/block/get_dev_name(os.path.realpath(dev)).

    The issue here is the error message doesn't report that path when failing while it might be involved in.

    This patch is about reporting where the code was looking at when trying to estimate if the partition was available.

    msg/simple: clear_pipe when wait() is mopping up pipes

    When wait is mopping up connections it may hit one that
    is in the process of accepting.  It will unregister it
    whilst the accept() thread is trying to set it up,
    aborting the accept and getting it reaped.  However,
    the pipe mop-up does not clear_pipe() the way that
    mark_down(), mark_down_all(), and fault() do, which
    leads to this assert.

    Pipe is accepting...

    ReplicatedBackend: don't queue Context outside of ObjectStore with obc

    We only flush the ObjectStore callbacks, not everything else.  Thus,
    there isn't a guarrantee that the obc held by pull_complete_info will
    be cleaned up before the Flush callback is triggered.  Instead, just
    defer clearing the pull state until the callback (it'll be cleaned up
    during the interval change) and remove the ObjectContext from
    pull_complete_info.

    os/bluestore/BlueFS: fix flush_bdev placement

    We need to flush any new writes on any fsync().  Notably, this includes
    the rocksdb log. However, previously _fsync was only doing a bdev flush if
    we also had a dirty bluefs journal and called into _sync_and_flush_journal.
    If we didn't, we weren't doing a flush() at all, which could lead to
    corrupted data.

    Fix this by moving the first flush_bdev *out* of _sync_and_flush_log.  (The
    second one is there to flush the bluefs journal; the first one was to
    ensure prior writes are stable.)  Instead, flush prior writes in all of the
    callers prior to calling _sync_and_flush_log.  This includes _fsync (and
    fixes the bug by covering the non-journal-flush path) as well as several
    other callers.

    os/bluestore/KernelDevice: make flush() thread safe

    flush() may be called from multiple racing threads (notably, rocksdb can call fsync via
    bluefs at any time), and we need to make sure that if one thread sees the io_since_flush
    command and does an actual flush, that other racing threads also wait until that flush is
    complete.  This is accomplished with a simple mutex!

    Also, set the flag on IO *completion*, since flush is only a promise about
    completed IOs, not submitted IOs.

    The logic in RGWLibFS::mkdir() validated bucket names, but not

    The negative side effect of this was not creating illegal objects

    not removing up the proposed object from FHCache, which produced a

    rgw_file: refcnt bugfixes

    This change includes 3 related changes:

    1. add required lock flags for FHCache updates--this is a crash
       bug under concurrent update/lookup

    2. omit to inc/dec refcnt on root filehandles in 2 places--the
       root handle current is not on the lru list, so it's not
       valid to do so

    3. based on observation of LRU behavior during creates/deletes,
       update (cohort) LRU unref to move objects to LRU when their
       refcount falls to SENTINEL_REFCNT--this cheaply primes the
       current reclaim() mechanism, so very significanty improves
       space use (e.g., after deletes) in the absence of scans
       (which is common due to nfs-ganesha caching)

    rgw_file:  interned RGWFileHandle objects need parent refs

    RGW NFS fhcache/RGWFileHandle operators assume existence of the
    full chain of parents from any object to the its fs_root--this is
    a consequence of the weakly-connected namespace design goal, and
    not a defect.

    This change ensures the invariant by taking a parent ref when
    objects are interned (when a parent ref is guaranteed).  Parent
    refs are returned when objects are destroyed--essentially by the
    invariant, such a ref must exist.

    The extra ref is omitted when parent->is_root(), as that node is
    not in the LRU cache.

    rgw_file: avoid stranding invalid-name bucket handles in fhcache

    To avoid a string copy in the common mkdir path, handles for
    proposed buckets currently are staged in the handle table, before
    being rejected.  They need to be destaged, not just marked deleted
    (because deleted objects are now assumed not to be linked, as of
    beaeff059375b44188160dbde8a81dd4f4f8c6eb).

    This triggered an unhandled Boost assert when deleting staged
    handles, as current safe_link mode requires first removing from
    the FHCache.

    rgw_file: rgw_readdir can't list multi-segment dirs

    This issue has one root cause in librgw, namely that the marker
    argument to these requests was incorrectly formatted (though the
    marker cache was working as intended).

    Secondarily, for nfs-ganesha users, there is a compounding issue
    that the RGW fsal was required by "temporary" convention to
    populate the entire dirent cache for a directory on a single
    readdir() invocation--the cache_inode/mdcache implementations
    invariantly pass (before future 2.5 changesets, currently in
    progress) a null pointer for the start cookie offset, intended
    to convey this.

    rgw_file: allow setattr on placeholder directories

    When a POSIX path <bucket>/foo/ is known only as an implicit path
    segment from other objects (e.g., <bucket>/foo/bar.txt), a case
    that would usually arise from S3 upload of such an object, an
    RGWFileHandle object representing "<bucket>/foo/" will be constructed
    as needed, with no backing in RGW.

    This is by design, but subsequently, if a setattr is performed on
    such a handle, we must be ready to create the object inline with
    storing the attributes.

    rgw_file: invalid use of RGWFileHandle::FLAG_EXACT_MATCH

    The change which introduced this flag also caused it to be
    given as the flags argument to RGWLibFS::stat_leaf() when called
    from rgw_lookup().

    This was incorrect:  in particular, when a directory is known only
    as a common prefix of other objects, the AWS namespace mapping
    convention requires lookup("foo") to match a non-materialized
    instance of "foo/" (case 2 in RGWLibFS::stat_leaf's stat loop).

    tests: move swift.py task to qa/tasks

    In preparation for moving this task from ceph/teuthology.git into ceph/ceph.git

    The move is necessary because jewel-specific changes are needed, yet teuthology
    does not maintain a separate branch for jewel. Also, swift.py is a
    Ceph-specific task so it makes more sense to have it in Ceph.

    The file open flags (O_foo) are platform specific. Normalize these flags

    radosgw/swift: clean up flush / newline behavior.

    The current code emits a newline after swift errors, but fails
    to account for it when it calculates 'content-length'.  This results in
    some clients (go github.com/ncw/swift) producing complaints about the
    unsolicited newline such as this,
            Unsolicited response received on idle HTTP channel starting with "\n"; err=<nil>

    This logic eliminates the newline on flush.  This makes the content length
    calculation correct and eliminates the stray newline.

    There was already existing separator logic in the rgw plain formatter
    that can emit a newline at the correct point.  It had been checking
    "len" to decide if previous data had been emitted, but that's reset to 0
    by flush().  So, this logic adds a new per-instance variable to separately
    track state that it emitted a previous item (and should emit a newline).

    rpm: Move ceph-disk to ceph-base

    The SELinux package now requires the ceph-disk binary but that one was
    part of the ceph-osd package. The ceph-disk python library is already
    packaged in ceph-base so moving ceph-disk to ceph-base seems like a
    reasonable next step.

    ceph-disk: Fix the file ownership, skip missing

    This commit fixes the file ownership for the /usr/bin/ and /etc/ceph
    files and skips missing files as some of the files that we do specify
    now can be missing from the system (not installed, e.f. radosgw).

    selinux: Do parallel relabel on package install

    We can take advantage of ceph-disk fix subcommand when doing a package
    install. We will keep using the differential fixfiles command otherwise.

    We also need to add relabel for /usr/bin/ daemons so that we could use
    this.

    cls/rgw: list_plain_entries() stops before bi_log entries

    list_plain_entries() was using encode_obj_versioned_data_key() to set
    its end_key, which gives a prefix of BI_BUCKET_OBJ_INSTANCE_INDEX[=2]

    that range between start_key and end_key would not only span the
    BI_BUCKET_OBJS_INDEX[=0] prefixes, but BI_BUCKET_LOG_INDEX[=1] prefixes
    as well. this can result in list_plain_entries() trying and failing to
    decode a rgw_bi_log_entry as a rgw_bucket_dir_entry

    osd/PrimaryLogPG: limit the number of concurrently trimming pgs

    This patch introduces an AsyncReserver for snap trimming to limit the
    number of pgs on any single OSD which can be trimming, as with backfill.
    Unlike backfill, we don't take remote reservations on the assumption
    that the set of pgs with trimming work to do is already well
    distributed, so it doesn't seem worth the implementation overhead to get
    reservations from the peers as well.

    ceph-disk: enable directory backed OSD at boot time

    https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/539385b143feee3905dceaf7a8faaced42f2d3c6
    introduced a regression preventing directory backed OSD from starting at
    boot time.

    For device backed OSD the boot sequence starts with ceph-disk@.service
    and proceeds to

        systemctl enable --runtime ceph-osd@.service

    where the --runtime ensure ceph-osd@12 is removed when the machine
    reboots so that it does not compete with the ceph-disk@/dev/sdb1 unit at
    boot time.

    However directory backed OSD solely rely on the ceph-osd@.service unit
    to start at boot time and will therefore fail to boot.

    The --runtime flag is selectively set for device backed OSD only.

    mon/MonClient: make get_mon_log_message() atomic

    * LogClient: move reset_session() into get_mon_log_message() and add a
      "flush" param to the latter. so it can get_mon_log_message()
      atomically. otherwise another call changing the log queue could sneak
      in between reset_session() and get_mon_log_message().
    * MonClient: add a "flush" param to do_send() so we can reset the
      LogClient session once we are connected to a monitor.

    tools/cephfs: set dir_layout when injecting inodes

    When we left this as zero, the MDS would interpret it was HASH_LINUX
    rather than the default HASH_RJENKINS.  Potentially that
    could cause problems if there perhaps were already dirfrags in
    the metadata pool that were set up using rjenkins.  Mainly
    it just seems more appropriate to explicitly set this field
    rather than hit the fallback behaviour.

    rbd: bench-write should return error if io-size >= 4G

    Currently if user perform bench-write with io-size > 4G
    then its crashing because currently during memory allocation
    bufferptr taking size of buffer as a unsigned and io-size > 4G
    will overflow with unsigned. so during memset operation it will
    try to set io_size size of memory area pointed by bufferptr,
    (bufferptr area is:  (4G - io_size)), so it will cause
    segmentation fault.

    Fix is to return error if io-size >= 4G

    In openstack swift, it also support the feature to cancel the object expiration,
    which could be found at last point in
    https://docs.openstack.org/user-guide/cli-swift-set-object-expiration.html. we
    can remove the object expiration by set 'X-Remove-Delete-At:'.

    This patch also could fix the bug that when we set the object expiration and
    then upload the same object to the container again. The previous object expiration
    also works, which is not compatible with the openstack swift.

    otherwise the settings in "workunit" tasks are always overridden by the

    "install" task updates itself with the "overrides" settings: it uses the
    "overrides" as the *defaults*.

    rgw: make sending Content-Length in 204 and 304 controllable

    This commit introduces a new configurable "rgw print prohibited
    content length" to let operator decide whether RadosGW complies
    to RFC 7230 (a part of the HTTP specification) or violates it
    but follows the Swift's behavior.

    osdc/Objecter: respect epoch barrier in _op_submit()

    Epoch barrier instructs us to avoid sending (i.e. pause) any OSD ops
    until we see a barrier epoch.  The only thing epoch_barrier check in
    target_should_be_paused() does is keep already paused ops paused.  We
    need to actually pause incoming OSD ops in _op_submit().

    common: fix segfault in public IPv6 addr picking

    sockaddr is only 16 bytes big, so declaring net as sockaddr
    and then casting to sockaddr_in6 in case of IPv6 cannot
    work.

    using sockaddr_storage works for both IPv4 and IPv6, and is
    used in other code parts as well.

    note that the tests did not find this issue as they declared
    the bigger structs and casted the references to (sockaddr *)

    systemd: remove ceph-create-keys from presets

    ceph-create-keys unit file was removed here:

    * https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/8bcb4646b6b9846bb965cdec3ca2a21eb3b26bab
    * https://github.com/ceph/ceph/commit/dc5fe8d415858358bd0baf5d8dce0a753f5e0cea

    As a consequence the systemctl preset command now fails to run since the
    unit does not exist anymore. Due to the redirection in /dev/null we
    don't know what's happening.

    Ultimately the mon unit doesn't get enabled and the mon service won't
    start after reboot.
    Removing the old/non-existent unit makes the command succeed now.

    osd: Add automatic repair for DBObjectMap bug

    Add repair command to ceph-osdomap-tool too

    Under some situations the previous rm_keys() code would
    generated a corrupt complete table.  There is no way to
    figure out what the table should look like now.  By removing
    the entries we fix the corruption and aren't much worse off
    because the corruption caused some deleted keys to re-appear.

    This doesn't breaking the parent/child relationship during
    repair because some of the keys may still be contained
    in the parent.

    We use m_work_queue of type ContextWQ in handle_update function but we
    do not include common/WorkQueue.h that defines ContextWQ. This results
    in dereference of an incomplete type and causes build error in latest
    Fedora rawhide (future 26).

    rbd: destination pool should be source pool if it is not specified

    Currently if user perform image rename operation and user give pool
    name as a optional parameter (--pool=<pool_name>) then currently
    its taking this optional pool name for source pool and making
    destination pool name default pool name.
    With this fix if user provide pool name as a optional pool name
    parameter then it  will consider both soruce and destination pool
    name as optional parameter pool name.

    rgw: clear old zone short ids on period update

    the short ids of old, removed zones were being kept in the period to
    guard against hash collisions with new zones

    but for a hash collision to cause a wrong object to sync, that object
    would have to be uploaded simultaneously to two different zones that had
    the same short id

    to avoid this, we just have to prevent the period from containing two
    colliding zones at the same time - we don't have to remember old zone
    short ids forever

    the yield macro is implemented with for/switch, so the breaks in

    so any of these breaks send RGWFetchAllMetaCR into an infinite loop

    removed the yield {} block, so that breaks will apply to the for loop as

    osd/PGLog: reindex properly on pg log split

    When pg_log_t::split_out_child() runs it builds the list, which means the
    old indexes are wrong (the point to bad memory), but index() will not
    rebuild them because ever since b858e869e78927dccebaa350d246bd74af7f1de9
    we won't rebuild them if they are already built.

    Fix that by calling unindex() before the split.

    Further, the new child log also needs to be indexed.  Fix that too.

    Since commit 4e28f9e63644 ("osd/OSDMap: clear osd_info, osd_xinfo on
    osd deletion"), weight is set to IN when OSD is deleted.  This changes
    the result of applying an incremental for clients, not just OSDs.
    Because CRUSH computations are obviously affected, pre-4e28f9e63644
    servers disagree with post-4e28f9e63644 clients on object placement,
    resulting in misdirected requests.

    weren't getting filled in, which meant the PG wasn't
    (necessarily) mapped to an OSD until the OSDMap updated
    and we recalculated mappings.

    Fix by sending us through the common code path so that

    we should not update pools_to_fix_pgp_num if the pool is not expanded or
    the pg_num is not increased due to pgs being created. this prevent us
    from fixing the pgp_num after done with thrashing if we actually did

    ceph-disk: dmcrypt activate must use the same cluster as prepare

    When dmcrypt is used, the fsid cannot be retrieved from the data
    partition because it is encrypted. Store the fsid in the lockbox to
    enable dmcrypt activation using the same logic as regular activation.

    The fsid is used to retrive the cluster name that was used during
    prepare, reason why activation does not and must not have a --cluster
    argument.

    tests: Thrasher: eliminate a race between kill_osd and __init__

    If Thrasher.__init__() spawns the do_thrash thread before initializing the
    ceph_objectstore_tool property, do_thrash races with the rest
    of Thrasher.__init__() and in some cases do_thrash can call kill_osd() before
    Trasher.__init__() progresses much further. This can lead to an exception
    ("AttributeError: Thrasher instance has no attribute 'ceph_objectstore_tool'")
    being thrown in kill_osd().

    This commit eliminates the race by making sure the ceph_objectstore_tool
    attribute is initialized before the do_thrash thread is spawned.

    osd/PG: restrict want_acting to up+acting on recovery completion

    On recovery completion we recalculate want_acting to see if we
    should add recently backfilled osds into acting.  However, at
    this point we may have gotten infos from others OSDs outside
    of up/acting that could be used for want_acting.  We currently
    assert that only up/acting osds are used in
    PG::RecoveryState::Active::react(const AdvMap&), so we must
    restrict want_acting to up/acting here.

    We could remove this restriction, but it would mean

    1) checking on every map change that want_acting hasn't been
    invalidated, and if so, recalculating want_acting and requesting
    a new pg_temp.  Also, presumably

    2) on each new info, checking whether we can construct a better
    want_acting, and if so, doing it.

    That would be a good thing, but is a more complicated change.  In
    reality this case comes up very rarely, so simply make our
    post-recovery want_acting calculation limit itself to up+acting.

    See 1db67c443d84dc5d1ff53cc820fdfd4a2128b680 for the assertion.

    Currently, we start/stop OSDs and MONs simultaneously. This may cause

    os/bluestore: fix statfs to not include DB partition in free space

    If we report the DB space as vailable, ceph thinks the OSD can store more
    data and will not mark the cluster as full as easily.  And in reality, we
    can't actually store data in this space--only metadata.  Avoid the problem
    by not reporting it as available.

    osd: do not send ENXIO on misdirected op by default

    In practice this tends to get bubbled up the stack as an error on
    the caller, and they usually do not handle it properly.  For example,
    with librbd, this turns into EIO and break the VM.

    Instead, this will manifest as a hung op on the client.  That is
    also not ideal, but given that the root cause here is generally a
    bug, it's not clear what else would be better.

    We already log an error in the cluster log, so teuthology runs will
    continue to fail.

    systemd: Restart Mon after 10s in case of failure

    In some situations the IP address the Monitor wants to bind to
    might not be available yet.

    This might for example be a IPv6 Address which is still performing
    DAD or waiting for a Router Advertisement to be send by the Router(s).

    Have systemd wait for 10s before starting the Mon and increase the amount
    of times it does so to 5.

    This allows the system to bring up IP Addresses in the mean time while
    systemd waits with restarting the Mon.

    Before this patch the flag was wrongly handled in the Swift API
    implementation. In rare conditions this might result in setting
    req_state::system_request.

    This may happen only if both of those conditions are fulfilled:
     * RadosGW is running in a multi-site configuration (at least
       one user with the system flag turned on is present),
     * the "rgw_swift_account_in_url" configurable has been switched
       to true. The value is false by default and our documentation
       doesn't actually mention about the option.

    The issue doesn't affect Jewel nor any previous release.

    mon: do not send duplicated osdmap msg to not sync'ed osd

    prior to this change:
    a peon may forward the pgstats to leader, and record it locally, but leader will
    check if osd has the latest map before process, if not, will use a route op to
    indicate peon to send it, then poen will delete routed op when fininaly send
    out which make peon cannot send pgstatack when leader has processed the
    pgstat update. so osd will always track it util reach a threshold block pgstats
    sending, at worst, reopen mon session.
    also, both leader and peon will send out the osdmap message to the osd.

    after this change:
    only the peon will send out the osdmap message. and the pgstatack message
    will be routed to the osd as expected. so the osd will not keep track of the
    "acked" pg stats in its queue forever before times out.

    client/Client.cc: prevent segfaulting

    The segfaulting in the rmdir function is caused by calling
    filepath::last_dentry() function.
    last_dentry() function assumes that the bits vector has always at
    least one element, which is not the case for the the filepath object
    created with "/" input.
    This commit also fixes other functions affected by this bug:
    link, unlink, rename, mkdir, mknod and symlink.

    mds/server: skip unwanted dn in handle_client_readdir

    We can skip unwanted dn which  < (offset_key, snap) via map.lower_bound, rather than
    iterate across them.

    Previously we iterate and skip dn which < (offset_key, dn->last), as dn->last >= snap
     means (offset_key, dn->last) >= (offset_key, snap), and such iterate_and_skip logic
    still keep, so this commit doesnt change code logic but an optimization.

    Ceph-disk to use correct user in check_journal_req

    The ceph-disk tool calls ceph-osd to check the journal requirements
    using OSD id 0. This creates a log file for osd-0 on the system
    using the current user/group for file permissions.  When ceph-disk
    is run as root this makes the file owned by root which makes
    the osd daemon for osd.0 unable to write to its own log file.

    This commit changes the journal reqs calls of ceph-osd to pass
    the ceph user and group so ceph-osd creates the log file with the
    appropriate permissions.
