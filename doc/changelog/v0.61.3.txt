    mon: start lease timer from peon_init()

    In the scenario:

     - leader wins, peons lose
     - leader sees it is too far behind on paxos and bootstraps
     - leader tries to sync with someone, waits for a quorum of the others
     - peons sit around forever waiting

    The problem is that they never time out because paxos never issues a lease,
    which is the normal timeout that lets them detect a leader failure.

    Avoid this by starting the lease timeout as soon as we lose the election.
    The timeout callback just does a bootstrap and does not rely on any other
    state.

    I see one possible danger here: there may be some "normal" cases where the
    leader takes a long time to issue its first lease that we currently
    tolerate, but won't with this new check in place.  I hope that raising
    the lease interval/timeout or reducing the allowed paxos drift will make
    that a non-issue.  If it is problematic, we will need a separate explicit
    "i am alive" from the leader while it is getting ready to issue the lease
    to prevent a live-lock.

    mon/Paxos: adjust trimming defaults up; rename options

    - trim more at a time (by an order of magnitude)
    - rename fields to paxos_trim_{min,max}; only trim when there are min items
      that are trimmable, and trim at most max items at a time.
    - adjust the paxos_service_trim_{min,max} values up by a factor of 2.

    Since we are compacting every time we trim, adjusting these up mean less
    frequent compactions and less overall work for the monitor.

    We don't actually need to write out the pg map epoch on every
    activate_map as long as:
    a) the osd does not trim past the oldest pg map persisted
    b) the pg does update the persisted map epoch from time
    to time.

    To that end, we now keep a reference to the last map persisted.
    The OSD already does not trim past the oldest live OSDMapRef.
    Second, handle_activate_map will trim if the difference between
    the current map and the last_persisted_map is large enough.

    mon: Paxos: get rid of the 'prepare_bootstrap()' mechanism

    We don't need it after all.  If we are in the middle of some proposal,
    then we guarantee that said proposal is likely to be retried.  If we
    haven't yet proposed, then it's forever more likely that a client will
    eventually retry the message that triggered this proposal.

    Basically, this mechanism attempted at fixing a non-problem, and was in
    fact triggering some unforeseen issues that would have required increasing
    the code complexity for no good reason.

    Fixes: #5102

    mon: Paxos: finish queued proposals instead of clearing the list

    By finishing these Contexts, we make sure the Contexts they enclose (to be
    called once the proposal goes through) will behave as their were initially
    planned:  for instance, a C_Command() may retry the command if a -EAGAIN
    is passed to 'finish_contexts', while a C_Trimmed() will simply set
    'going_to_trim' to false.

    This aims at fixing at least a bug in which Paxos will stop trimming if an
    election is triggered while a trim is queued but not yet finished.  Such
    happens because it is the C_Trimmed() context that is responsible for
    resetting 'going_to_trim' back to false.  By clearing all the contexts on
    the proposal list instead of finishing them, we stay forever unable to
    trim Paxos again as 'going_to_trim' will stay True till the end of time as
    we know it.

    FileJournal: adjust write_pos prior to unlocking write_lock

    In committed_thru, we use write_pos to reset the header.start value in cases
    where seq is past the end of our journalq.  It is therefore important that the
    journalq be updated atomically with write_pos (that is, under the write_lock).

    The call to align_bl() is moved into do_write in order to ensure that write_pos
    is adjusted correctly prior to write_bl().

    Also, we adjust pos at the end of write_bl() such that pos \in [get_top(),
    header.max_size) after write_bl().

    librbd: make image creation defaults configurable

    Programs using older versions of the image creation functions can't
    set newer parameters like image format and fancier striping.

    Setting these options lets them use all the new functionality without
    being patched and recompiled to use e.g. rbd_create3().
    This is particularly useful for things like qemu-img, which does not
    know how to create format 2 images yet.
