    cls_rgw: change scoping of suggested changes vars
    
    Fixes: #3127
    Bad variable scoping made it so that specific variables
    weren't initialized between suggested changes iterations.
    This specifically affected a case where in a specific
    change we had an updated followed by a remove, and the
    remove was on a non-existent key (e.g., was already
    removed earlier). We ended up re-substracting the
    object stats, as the entry wasn't reset between
    the iterations (and we didn't read it because the
    key didn't exist).

    objecter: fix osdmap wait
    
    When we get a pool_op_reply, we find out which osdmap we need to wait for.
    The wait_for_new_map() code was feeding that epoch into
    maybe_request_map(), which was feeding it to the monitor with the subscribe
    request.  However, that epoch is the *start* epoch, not what we want.  Fix
    this code to always subscribe to what we have (+1), and ensure we keep
    asking for more until we catch up to what we know we should eventually
    get.

    objecter: use ordered map<> for tracking tids to preserve order on resend
    
    We are using a hash_map<> to map tids to Op*'s.  In handle_osd_map(),
    we will recalc_op_target() on each Op in a random (hash) order.  These
    will get put in a temp map<tid,Op*> to ensure they are resent in the
    correct order, but their order on the session->ops list will be random.
    
    Then later, if we reset an OSD connection, we will resend everything for
    that session in ops order, which is be incorrect.
    
    Fix this by explicitly reordering the requests to resend in
    kick_requests(), much like we do in handle_osd_map().  This lets us
    continue to use a hash_map<>, which is faster for reasonable numbers of
    requests.  A simpler but slower fix would be to just use map<> instead.
    
    This is one of many bugs contributing to #2947.

    rbd: make --pool/--image args easier to understand for import
    
    There's no need to set the default pool in set_pool_image_name - this
    is done later, in a way that doesn't ignore --pool if --dest-pool
    is not specified.
    
    This means --pool and --image can be used with import, just like
    the rest of the commands. Without this change, --dest and --dest-pool
    had to be used, and --pool would be silently ignored for rbd import.

    Instead of allowing this to happen, return -ESTALE if the snapshot id
    is lower than the currently stored snapshot sequence number. On the

    upstart, ceph-create-keys: Make client.admin key generation automatic.
    
    This should help simplify Chef etc deployments. Now (when using the
    Upstart jobs), when a ceph-mon is started, ceph-create-admin-key is
    triggered. If /etc/ceph/$cluster.client.admin.keyring already exists,
    it does nothing; otherwise, it waits for ceph-mon to reach quorum, and
    then does a "ceph auth get-or-create" to create the key, and writes it
    atomically to disk.
    
    The equivalent code can be removed from the Chef cookbook once this is
    in.

    upstart: Make ceph-osd always set the crush location.
    
    This used to be conditional on config having osd_crush_location set,
    but with that, minimal configuration left the OSD completely out of
    the crush map, and prevented the OSD from starting properly.
    
    Note: Ceph does not currently let this mechanism automatically move
    hosts to another location in the CRUSH hierarchy. This means if you
    let this run with defaults, setting osd_crush_location later will not
    take effect. Set up your config file (or Chef environment) fully
    before starting the OSDs the first time.
