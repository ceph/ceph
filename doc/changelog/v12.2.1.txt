    qa/suites/krbd: new rbd_xfstests job definition
    
    ext4 seems to be a better choice for our purposes -- less test churn,
    rather small and reliable exclude list.
    
    All excluded tests but generic/050 fail with no krbd in the mix, most
    have popped up on linux-ext4 list at least once.

    qa/tasks/rbd.xfstests: take exclude list from yaml
    
    Different filesystems (and further, different configurations of the
    same filesystem) need different exclude lists.  Hard coding the list in

    qa/run_xfstests.sh: quit building xfstests on test nodes
    
    xfstests is a pain to build on trusty, xenial and centos7 with a single
    script.  It is also very sensitive to dependencies, which again need to
    be managed on all those distros -- different sets of supported commands
    and switches, some versions have known bugs, etc.
    
    Download a pre-built, statically linked tarball and use it instead.
    The tarball was generated using xfstests-bld by Ted Ts'o, with a number
    of tweaks by myself (mostly concerning the build environment).

    client: set client_try_dentry_invalidate to false by default
    
    By default, ceph-fuse uses side effect of 'dentry invalidation' to
    trim kernel dcache if it runs on kernel < 3.18. The implemention of
    kernel function d_invalidate() changed in 3.18 kernel, the method no
    longer works for upstream kernel >= 3.18.
    
    RHEL 3.10 kernel includes backport of patches that change implemention
    of d_invalidate(). So checking kernel version to decide if 'dentry
    invalidation' method works is unreliable.

    qa/tasks/cephfs: Whitelist POOL_APP_NOT_ENABLED for test_misc
    
    test_misc verifies that ceph fs new will not create a filesystem
    on a pool that already contains objects. As part of the test, it
    inserts a dummy object into a pool and then attempts to use it for
    CephFS. This triggers POOL_APP_NOT_ENABLED. Setting the application
    metadata for the pool (and having ceph fs new fail because of the
    existing metadata) would then exercise a different failure case.

    client: add mountedness check inside client_lock
    
    Currently we check for mountedness in the high level wrappers, but those
    checks are lockless. It's possible to have a call that races with
    ceph_unmount(). It could pass one of the is_mounted() checks in the
    wrapper, and then block on the client_lock while the unmount is actually
    running. Eventually it picks up and runs after the unmount returns, with
    questionable results -- possibly even a crash in some cases.
    
    For now, we can explain this away with a simple admonition that
    applications should ensure that no calls are running when ceph_unmount
    is called. In the future though, we may need to forcibly shut down the
    mount when certain events occur (not returning a lease or delegation in
    time, for instance).
    
    Sprinkle in a bunch of "unmounting" checks after taking the client_lock,
    and simply have the functions return errors (or sensible values in some
    cases) when the Client is being downed. With that, we ensure that this
    sort of race can't occur, even when the unmount is not being driven by
    userland. Note too that in some places I've replaced assertions in the
    code with error returns, as that's nicer behavior for libraries.
    
    Note that this can't replace the ->is_mounted() checks in the lockless
    wrappers as those are needed to determine whether the client pointer in
    the ceph_mount_info is still valid. The admonition not to allow
    ceph_unmount to race with other calls is therefore still necessary.

    mds: void sending cap import message when inode is frozen
    
    To export an inode to other mds, mds need to:
    
    - Freeze the inode (stop issuing caps to clients)
    - Flush client sessions (ensure client have received all cap messages)
    - Send cap export message
    
    These steps guarantee that clients receive cap import/export messages
    in proper order (In the case that inode gets exported servel times
    within a short time)
    
    When inode is frozen, mds may have already flushed client sessions.
    So mds shouldn't send cap import messages.

    client: fix message order check in handle_cap_export()
    
    If importer mds' cap already exists, but cap ID mismatches, client
    should have received corresponding import message (the imported caps
    got released later). Because cap ID does not change as long as client
    holds the caps.

    mds: check ongoing catter-gather process before capping log
    
    When deactivating mds, MDLog::trim() may start scatter-gather
    process on mdsdir inode. Locker::scatter_writebehind() submits
    log entry. So mds should make sure there is no scatter-gather
    before capping log.

    osd: request new map from PG when needed
    
    The fast dispatch refactor in 3cc48278bf0ee5c9535d04b60a661f988c50063b
    eliminated the osdmap subscription in the ms_fast_dispatch path, which
    meant ops could reach a PG without having the latest map. In a cluster
    with few osdmap updates, where the monitor fails to send a new map to
    an osd (it tries one random osd), this can result in indefinitely
    blocked requests.
    
    Fix this by adding an OSDService mechanism for scheduling a new osdmap
    subscription request.

    Revert "osd/OSDMap: allow bidirectional swap of pg-upmap-items"
    
    This reverts commit 09af9b8afb40cc8aa629501582a75e03edf0bf2e.
    
    We need to prevent duplicates in the final result.  For example, we
    can currently take
     [1,2,3] and apply [(1,2)] and get [2,2,3]
    or
     [1,2,3] and apply [(3,2)] and get [1,2,2]
    
    The rest of the system is not prepared to handle duplicates in the
    result set like this.
    
    The reverted commit was intended to allow
    
     [1,2,3] and [(1,2),(2,1)] to get [2,1,3]
    
    to reorder primaries.  First, this bidirectional swap is hard to implement
    in a way that also prevents dups.  For example,
     [1,2,3] and [(1,4),(2,3),(3,4)] would give [4,3,4]
    but would we just drop the last step we'd have [4,3,3] which
    is also invalid, etc.  Simpler to just not handle bidirectional
    swaps.  In practice, they are not needed: if you just want to choose
    a different primary then use primary_affinity, or pg_upmap
    (not pg_upmap_items).

    mds: print subtrees only after merge
    
    During up:resolve, the MDS tries to merge each subtree with its parent. During
    testing, QE found that many thousands of subtrees in a directory (made possible
    using pins) would cause the MDS to spend minutes printing out subtree maps to
    the debug log. This causes the heartbeat code to consider the MDS as stalled so
    beacons are no longer sent to the mons resulting in the MDS being removed from
    the rank.
    
    A more complete solution to this problem is to selectively print subtrees
    relating to the operation (e.g. the subtree and its parents).

    mds: support limiting cache by memory
    
    This introduces two config parameters:
    
        mds_cache_memory_limit: Sets the soft maximum of the cache to the given
        byte count. (Like mds_cache_size, this doesn't actually limit the maximum
        size of the cache. It just dictates the steady-state size.)
    
        mds_cache_reservation: This replaces mds_health_cache_threshold everywhere
        except the Beacon heartbeat sent to the mons. The idea here is to specify a
        reservation of memory (5% by default) for operations and the MDS tries to
        always maintain that reservation. So, the MDS will recall caps from clients
        when it begins dipping into its reservation of memory.
    
    mds_cache_size still limits the cache by Inode count but is now by-default 0
    (i.e. unlimited). The new preferred way of specifying cache limits is by memory
    size. The default is 1GB.

    common: refactor of lru
    
    Avoids an unnecessary "max" size of the LRU which was used to calculate the
    midpoint. Instead, just dynamically move the LRUObjects between top and bottom
    on-the-fly.
    
    This change is necessary for a cache which which does not limit by the number
    of objects but by some other metric. (In this case, memory.)

    mds: go back to compact_map for replicas
    
    Zheng observed that an alloc_ptr doesn't really work in this case since any
    call to get_replicas() will cause the map to be allocated, nullifying the
    benefit. Use a compact_map until a better solution can be written. (This means
    that the map will be allocated outside the mempool.)

    mds: use mempool for cache objects
    
    The purpose of this is to allow us to track memory usage by cached objects so
    we can limit cache size based on memory available/allocated to the MDS.
    
    This commit is a first step: it adds CInode, CDir, and CDentry to the mempool
    but not all of the containers in these classes (e.g. std::map). However,
    MDSCacheObject has been changed to allocate its containers through the mempool
    by converting compact_* containers to the std versions offered through mempool
    via the new alloc_ptr.
    
    (A compact_* class simply wraps a pointer to the std:: version to reduce memory
    usage of an object when the container is only occasionally used. The alloc_ptr
    allows us to achieve the same thing explicitly with only a little handholding:
    when all entries in the wrapped container are deleted, the caller must call
    alloc_ptr.release().)

    drop_standby() was killing it and it was only getting added
    back in certain locations.  Instead, make the metadata
    drop conditional and only do it in the places we're
    really dropping the daemon, not when we're promoting
    it to active.

    tools/ceph_objectstore_tool: fix 'dup' unable to duplicate meta PG
    
    Recently we plan to bring a Jewel cluster into Luminous.
    After that is done, which turns out to be a big success,
    we then try to transform all FileStore osds into BlueStore ones
    offline but with no luck. The ceph_objectstore_tool keeps complaining:
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    dup from filestore: /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-20.old
          to bluestore: /var/lib/ceph/osd/ceph-20
    fsid d444b253-337d-4d15-9d63-86ae134ec9ac
    65 collections
    1/65 meta
    cannot get bit count for collection meta: (61) No data available
    --------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    The root cause is that for FileStore Luminous will always try to rewrite
    pg "bits" as a file attribute on "Load" if that is not available.
    But since meta pg is never loaded (we skip it during OSD::load_pgs()),
    we actually never get the chance to do so; hence making the
    dup method from ceph_objectstore_tool very unhappy since it always
    expects to see such a attribute from underlying store.
    
    Fix the above problem by manually skipping loading the "bits" attribute
    if underlying OS is FileStore for dup.

    build/ops: rpm: do not create librbd.so.1 symlink in /usr/lib64/qemu
    
    As reported by Ademar de Souza Reis Jr <areis@redhat.com>:
    
    This symlink should not be necessary anymore. QEMU is properly linked to
    ceph/librbd these days (look at the qemu-block-rbd sub-package in Fedora and
    the respective package in RHEL).
    
    The symlink was a hack from a time when librbd was distributed and supported by
    ceph and the rbd driver would be enabled at runtime only when/if the symlink
    was present.
    
    So the right fix is to actually get rid of the symlink altogether and never
    touch (much less own) /usr/lib64/qemu.

    osd/PGBackend, MOSDPGRecoveryDelete[Reply]: handle incompatible encoding
    
    Handle a pre-luminous encoding without min_epoch for both these
    messages.  Bump the header version, so the simple path of inline
    decoding works for the future.  For 12.2.0 and pre-luminous, we can
    check the SERVER_LUMINOUS flag on the connection to tell which
    encoding to use.
    
    This is not a cherry-pick from master since all upgrades must stop at
    luminous, and will use the existing encoding before continuing.

    os/bluestore: drop deferred_submit_lock
    
    This lock serves no purpose.  It only protects the call to the aio_submit
    on the OpSequencer running batch, but we are the only caller who will do
    that submission, and a new batch won't be moved into place until ours is
    completed and retired (by the completion for the aio we are queueing).
    
    More importantly, this fixes a deadlock:
    
    - thread A submits aio, but the queue is full, and blocks
    - thread B blocks taking deferred_submit_lock while holding deferred_lock
    - aio completion thread blocks trying to take deferred_lock, and thus
    no further aios are drained.

    rgw: add tail tag to track tail instance
    
    Use tail_tag instead of idtag. The tail_tag is modified when either
    creating a new tail, or adding a refcount to the tail (e.g., when
    copying object). When just modifying the object's head, tail_tag
    should remain the same. The gc will then use the tail_tag (if
    exists, idtag if not) as the refcount id.

    crush: fix fast rule lookup when uniform
    
    Older clients will search for the first rule with a matching ruleset,
    type, and size.  The has_uniform_rules bool is only set if we have rule
    ids and rulesets that line up, but we must also verify that the rest of the
    mask matches or else we can get a different CRUSH mapping result because
    the mask might not match and old clients will fail to find a rule and we
    will find one.  We also can't just check the ruleset as the legacy clients
    find the *first* (of potentially many) matching rules; hence we only do
    the fast check if all rulesets == rule id.

    osd/PG: discard msgs from down peers
    
    if a repop is replied after a replica goes down in a new osdmap, and
    before the pg advances to this new osdmap, the repop replies before this
    repop can be discarded by that replica OSD, because the primary resets the
    connection to it when handling the new osdmap marking it down, and also
    resets the messenger sesssion when the replica reconnects. to avoid the
    out-of-order replies, the messages from that replica should be discarded.

    interval_set: optimize intersect_of insert operations
    
    Use the std::map insert method with hint iterator to optimize
    inserts. This increases performance more than 3.5 times for
    large numbers of intervals. This will help performance
    especially in the PGPool::update method, where profiling data
    has shown that intersection operations are a hot spot. The
    following benchmark data is for 400000 intervals:

    rgw_lc: add support for optional filter argument and make ID optional
    
    Support Filter tag in Lifecycle XML similar to AWS S3, while S3 docs
    mention that this tag is mandatory, older clients still default to
    Prefix, and S3 itself seems to relaxed in enforcing the rule, this
    implementation also follows a similar pattern. Filter optionally
    supports filtering via (multiple) Object Tags, this is still a TODO. The
    current implementation of object tags is still as an object xattr, and
    since the LC processing still iterates over the bucket index which
    currently doesn't have any info. on tags, this requires some thought
    into for implementing without a larger performance penalty

    rgw: fix obj copied from remote gateway acl full_control issue
    
    This part of the code is commit in
    ea3efca
    
    When copy a object to a remote gateway, the check processing which is
    done by
    "Bitwise And" between source object's acl elements and
    grants_headers_def array elements
    will be done to produce the target object's acl elements.
    
    So when the full_control is the first element of grants_headers_def, no
    matter the
    source object's acl element permission field is write or read, the
    result of
    bitwise and will always be true, then call grants_by_type_add_one_grant
    with
    check_perm which is full_control, all of the permission field of the
    target object's
    acl elements will be full_control.

    client: skip lookupname if writing to unlinked file
    
    When a client writes to an unlinked file, get_quota_root tries to
    resolve the filename via an MDS lookupname op. The op always results in
    -13 permission denied for path-restricted caps or -2 no such file or
    directory otherwise. More importantly, the repeated lookupname ops slow
    down buffered writes significantly.
    
    Don't do the lookupname for unlinked files; use the root_ancentor's
    quota instead.

    rpm: ceph-fuse requires fuse package
    
    The ceph-fuse(8) man page describes using the "fusermount" tool to mount
    CephFS. This utility is in the "fuse" package. Prior to this change, the
    ceph-fuse RPM only depends on "fuse-libs", not "fuse".
    
    The Debian packaging has always depended on the full "fuse" (previously
    "fuse-utils") package, so we should make the RPM packaging do the same.

    Test bytes_sent bugs.
    
    Rearrange logic to make it easier to measure accumulation.
    Instrument the boto request/response loop to count bytes in and out.
    Accumulate byte counts in usage like structure.
    Compare actual usage reported by ceph against local usage measured.
    Report and assert if there are any short-comings.
    Remove zone placement rule that was newly added at end: tests should be rerunable.
    
    Nit: the logic to wait for "delete_obj" is not quite right.

    Fix bytes_sent bugs.
    
    log bytes sent/received.
    add cct to bufferingfilter
    add cct to RGWRestfulIO
    AccountingFilter - save cct for debugging output
    implement AccountingFilter::complete_request() - account for bytes reported here.
    BufferingFilter<T>::complete_request() - ignore counts from send_content_length() complete_header();
    
    Code quality note:
    this patch makes "cct" available for a lot of newly added debug
    statements.  The debug statements are mostly not very useful (and should
    go away in the future) - *But* the "cct" logic should be redone and
    incorporated into some base class (such RestfulClient) so that it is
    possible to easily add in debug statements such as these in the future.

    This makes it easier to test whether the upgrade + conversion has
    completed.  In particular, mimic+ will be able to simply test for this
    flag without waiting for complete PG stats to know whether it is safe to
    upgrade beyond luminous.

    osd/PGLog: write only changed dup entries
    
    Writing all of the dup entries whenever one is changed causes a large
    regression in performance.
    
    Instead, keep track of ranges that need to be cleared and written
    after log merging (dirty_{to,from}_dups) and the earliest dup entry we
    haven't written yet during normal operation (write_from_dups). This
    parallels the way we track unpersisted log entries.
    
    Check that the correct set of dups is persisted by adding a roundtrip
    through memstore to each merge_log unit test.
