    tests: robust test for the pool create crushmap test
    
    The test that goes with f1e86be589803596e86acc964ac5c5c03b4038d8 to
    verify that a bugous crush ruleset will prevent the creation of a pool
    trying to use it was fragile. I depends on the implementation of the
    erasure code lrc plugin and turns out to not work on i386.
    
    The test is modified to use a fake crushtool that always returns false
    and validate that it prevents the creation of a pool, which demonstrate
    it is used for crushmap validation prior to the pool creation.

    crush/CrushTester: test fewer inputs when running crushtool
    
    If there are a lot of crush rules (say, 100) then the test can
    take a long time.  100 values per rule should be enough to catch
    most issues.

    upstart: limit respawn to 3 in 30 mins (instead of 5 in 30s)
    
    It may take tens of seconds to restart each time, so 5 in 30s does not stop
    the crash on startup respawn loop in many cases.  In particular, we'd like
    to catch the case where the internal heartbeats fail.
    
    This should be enough for all but the most sluggish of OSDs and capture
    many cases of failure shortly after startup.

    osd/PG: peek_map_epoch: skip legacy PGs if infos object is missing
    
    - pg is removed
    - osd is stopped before pg is fully removed
    - on restart, we ignore/skip the pg because its epoch is too old
    - we upgrade to hammer and convert other pgs, skipping this one, and then
      remove the legacy infos object
    - hammer starts, tries to parse the legacy pg, and fails because the infos
      object is gone, crashing.
    
    The fix is to continue ignoring the zombie pg.

    osd: trigger the cache agent after a promotion
    
    When a proxy read happens, the object promotion is done in parallel. The
    agent_choose_mode function must be called to reconsider the situation
    to protect against the following scenario:
    
      * proxy read
      * agent_choose_mode finds no object exists and the agent
        goes idle
      * object promotion happens
      * the agent does not reconsider and eviction does not happen

    Switched to context-aware NSS init/shutdown functions to avoid conflicts

    NSS crypto library when the last CephContext is destroyed.  This avoids
    memory leaks with the NSS library from users of librados.

    Swift sends Content-Type HTTP header even if the response

    Unfortunately, lack of Content-Type causes early exits in

    mon: test the crush ruleset when creating a pool
    
    We want to fix the following scenario:
    
     * an erasure code plugin (or another part of the code) creates a
       ruleset
     * the ruleset crashes during mapping (for whatever reason)
     * ceph osd pool create uses the bugous ruleset
     * the monitors try to do mapping a crash
    
    Having a bugous ruleset in the crush map is very difficult prevent. The
    catastrophic event of using it with a newly created pool can however be
    prevented by calling the CrushTester just before creating the pool and
    after all implicit or explicit crush ruleset creation happened.

    rgw: list_objects() sets namespace appropriately
    
    list_objects() now uses parse_raw_oid(), so that it can set the correct
    namespace. It only affects users of the function that want to get all
    objects in bucket, regardless to the namespace associated with it. This
    makes it so that the orphan code actually works now with namespaced
    objects, and with special named objects (namely, start with underscore).

    osd/OSDMap: handle incrementals that modify+del pool
    
    Because new_pools was processed after old_pools, if something
    was modified and then deleted in the same incremental
    map, then the resulting state would be a pool in the map
    that had no entry in pool_name.

    the same time as a post-hammer OSD.
    
    This commit, as well as the definition of the sentinal post-hammer

    hobject_t: decode future hobject_t::get_min() properly
    
    The post-hammer wip-temp branch changed hobject_t::get_min() so that pool
    is INT64_MIN instead of -1 and neglected to deal with the encoding compat
    with older versions.  Compensate on hammer by mapping INT64_MIN to -1
    locally.  See commit ff99af38df830e215359bfb8837bf310a2023a4d.
    
    Note that this means upgrades from hammer to post-hammer *must* include
    this fix prior to the upgrade.  This will need to be well-documented in the
    release notes.
    
    Master gets a similar fix so that they map our min value to the new
    INT64_MIN one on decode.

    librbd: simplify state machine handling of exclusive lock
    
    It is expected that all IO is flushed and all async ops are cancelled
    prior to releasing the exclusive lock.  Therefore, replace handling of
    lost exclusive locks in state machines with an assertion.

    packaging: RGW depends on /etc/mime.types
    
    If the mimecap RPM or mime-support DEB is not installed, then the
    /etc/mime.types file is not present on the system. RGW attempts to read
    this file during startup, and if the file is not present, RGW logs an
    error:
    
      ext_mime_map_init(): failed to open file=/etc/mime.types ret=-2
    
    Make the radosgw package depend on the mailcap/mime-support packages so
    that /etc/mime.types is always available on RGW systems.

    Client: check dir is still complete after dropping locks in _readdir_cache_cb
    
    We drop the lock when invoking the callback, which means the directory
    we're looking at might get dentries trimmed out of memory. Make sure that
    hasn't happened after we get the lock back. If it *has* happened, fall back
    to requesting the directory contents from the MDS. Update the dirp location
    pointers after each entry to facilitate this.
    Because this requires we update the dirp->at_cache_name value on every loop,
    we rework the updating scheme a bit: to dereference the dn->name before
    unlocking, so we know it's filled in; and since we update it on every loop
    we don't need to refer to the previous dentry explicitly like we did before.
    
    This should also handle racing file deletes: we get back a trace on
    the removed dentry and that will clear the COMPLETE|ORDERED flags.

    mon: PaxosService: call post_refresh() instead of post_paxos_update()
    
    Whenever the monitor finishes committing a proposal, we call
    Monitor::refresh_from_paxos() to nudge the services to refresh.  Once
    all services have refreshed, we would then call each services
    post_paxos_update().
    
    However, due to an unfortunate, non-critical bug, some services (mainly
    the LogMonitor) could have messages pending in their
    'waiting_for_finished_proposal' callback queue [1], and we need to nudge
    those callbacks.
    
    This patch adds a new step during the refresh phase: instead of calling
    directly the service's post_paxos_update(), we introduce a
    PaxosService::post_refresh() which will call the services
    post_paxos_update() function first and then nudge those callbacks when
    appropriate.
    
    [1] - Given the monitor will send MLog messages to itself, and given the
    service is not readable before its initial state is proposed and
    committed, some of the initial MLog's would be stuck waiting for the
    proposal to finish.  However, by design, we only nudge those message's
    callbacks when an election finishes or, if the leader, when the proposal
    finishes.  On peons, however, we would only nudge those callbacks if an
    election happened to be triggered, hence the need for an alternate path
    to retry any message waiting for the initial proposal to finish.

    ceph.spec.in: python-argparse only in Python 2.6
    
    argparse is a widely-used Python module for parsing command-line arguments.
    Ceph makes heavy use of Python scripts, both in the build environment and on
    cluster nodes and clients.
    
    Until Python 2.6, argparse was distributed separately from Python proper.
    As of 2.7 it is part of the Python standard library.
    
    Although the python package in a given distro may or may not Provide:
    python-argparse, this cannot be relied upon.
    
    Therefore, this commit puts appropriate conditionals around Requires:
    python-argparse and BuildRequires: python-argparse. It does so for Red
    Hat/CentOS and SUSE only, because the last Fedora version with Python 2.6
    was Fedora 13, which is EOL.
    
    argparse is required by both the ceph and ceph-common packages, but since ceph
    requires ceph-common, the argparse Requires and BuildRequires need only appear
    once, under ceph-common.

    However, RPMLINT is not so complaining, so drop fdupes.
