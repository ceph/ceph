 Governance
============

The Ceph open source community is guided by a few different groups.

Key principles
==============

 * Decision-making is consensus-driven by those who participate.
 * Leadership roles are defined primarily by responsibility, not prestige or seniority.
 * It is normal and healthy for these roles to be passed on to others
 * Everyone's role is ultimately to serve the users and participation
   is voluntary.

Bodies
------

Ceph Executive Council
======================

Responsibilities
----------------

 * Arbiter in cases where decisions cannot be reached by consensus
 * Distribute key responsibilities amongst themselves or others
 * Point of contact for the project
 * Representatives for Ceph foundation board meetings
 * Ensure things get done
   
Membership
----------

 * 3 people
 * Elected by the steering committee
 * Candidates self-nominate or are nominated by other members
 * Discussion of how roles/responsibilities may be delegated
 * Ranked-choice vote by the steering committee
 * 2 year terms, with one member being elected in even years, and the
   other two in odd years
 * Members may resign at any time, and the steering committee may vote
   to appoint a replacement for the rest of their term

   and improvements

Membership
----------

   supermajority vote
