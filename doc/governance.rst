 Governance
============

The Ceph open source community is guided by a few different groups.

Key principles
==============

 * Decision-making is consensus-driven by those who participate.
 * Leadership roles are defined primarily by responsibility, not prestige or seniority.
 * It is normal and healthy for these roles to be passed on to others
 * Everyone's role is ultimately to serve the users and participation
   is voluntary.

Bodies
------

Ceph Executive Council
======================

Responsibilities
----------------

 * Arbiter in cases where decisions cannot be reached by consensus
 * Distribute key responsibilities amongst themselves or others
 * Point of contact for the project
 * Representatives for Ceph foundation board meetings
 * Ensure things get done
   
Membership
----------

 * 3 people
 * Elected by the steering committee
 * Candidates self-nominate or are nominated by other members
 * Discussion of how roles/responsibilities may be delegated
 * Ranked-choice vote by the steering committee
 * 2 year terms, with one member being elected in even years, and the
   other two in odd years

of the Ceph open source project beyond offering feedback and input
into the collaborative development process.
