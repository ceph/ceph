============
 Governance
============

The Ceph open source community is guided by a few different groups.

Project Leader
--------------

The Ceph project is currently led by Sage Weil <sage@redhat.com>.  The
project leader is responsible for guiding the overall direction of the
project and ensuring that the developer and user communities are
healthy.


Committers
----------

Committers are project contributors who have write access to the central
Ceph code repositories, currently hosted on GitHub.  This group of developers
is collectively empowered to make changes to the Ceph source code.

Generally speaking, no individual should make a change in isolation:
all code contributions go through a collaborative review process (and
undergo testing) before being merged.  The specifics of this process
are dynamic and evolving over time.

New committers are added to the project (or committers removed from
the project) at the discretion of the Ceph Leadership Team (below).
The criteria for becoming a contributor include a consistent level of
quality and engagement in the project over time.


.. _clt:

Ceph Leadership Team
--------------------

The Ceph Leadership Team (CLT) is a collection of component leads and
other core developers who collectively make technical decisions for
the project.  These decisions are generally made by consensus,
although voting may be used if necessary.

The CLT meets weekly via video chat to discuss any pending issues or
decisions.  Minutes for the CLT meetings are published at
`https://pad.ceph.com/p/clt-weekly-minutes <https://pad.ceph.com/p/clt-weekly-minutes>`_.

Committers are added to or removed from the CLT at the discretion of
the CLT itself.

Current CLT members are:

 * Abhishek Lekshmanan <abhishek@suse.com>
 * Alfredo Deza <adeza@redhat.com>
 * Casey Bodley <cbodley@redhat.com>
 * Gregory Farnum <gfarnum@redhat.com>
 * Haomai Wang <haomai@xsky.com>
 * Jason Dillaman <dillaman@redhat.com>
 * Josh Durgin <jdurgin@redhat.com>
 * João Eduardo Luis <joao@suse.de>
 * Ken Dreyer <kdreyer@redhat.com>
 * Lenz Grimmer <lgrimmer@suse.com>
 * Matt Benjamin <mbenjami@redhat.com>
 * Myoungwon Oh <omwmw@sk.com>
 * Neha Ojha <nojha@redhat.com>
 * Sage Weil <sage@redhat.com>
 * Sebastian Wagner <swagner@suse.com>
 * Xie Xingguo <xie.xingguo@zte.com.cn>
 * Yehuda Sadeh <yehuda@redhat.com>
 * Zack Cerza <zcerza@redhat.com>

Component Leads
---------------

Each major subcomponent of the Ceph project has a lead engineer who is
responsible for guiding and coordinating development.  The leads are
nominated or appointed at the discretion of the project leader or the
CLT.  Leads responsibilities include:

 * guiding the (usually) daily "stand-up" coordination calls over video chat
 * building the development roadmap for each release cycle
 * coordinating development activity between contributors
 * ensuring that contributions are reviewed
 * ensuring that different proposed changes do not conflict
 * ensuring that testing remains robust (new features include tests, changes do not break tests, etc.)

All component leads are included on the CLT.  They are expected to
report progress and status updates to the rest of the leadership team
and to help facilitate any cross-component coordination of
development.

The Ceph Foundation
-------------------

The Ceph Foundation is organized as a directed fund under the Linux
Foundation and is tasked with supporting the Ceph project community
and ecosystem.  It has no direct control over the technical direction
of the Ceph open source project beyond offering feedback and input
into the collaborative development process.
