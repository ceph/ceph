# there are two sections

# releases: ... for named releases
# development: ... for dev releases
#
# by default a `version` is interpreted as a sphinx reference when rendered (see
# schedule.rst for the existing tags such as `_13.2.2`). If a version should not
# be treated as a reference, add `skip_ref: True` as a key/value pair sibling to
# the `version` key.
#
# If a version might represent an actual number (e.g. 0.80) quote it.
