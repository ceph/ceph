v0.87 Giant
===========

This release will form the basis for the stable release Giant,
v0.87.x.  Highlights for Giant include:

* *RADOS Performance*: a range of improvements have been made in the
  OSD and client-side librados code that improve the throughput on
  flash backends and improve parallelism and scaling on fast machines.
* *CephFS*: we have fixed a raft of bugs in CephFS and built some
  basic journal recovery and diagnostic tools.  Stability and
  performance of single-MDS systems is vastly improved in Giant.
  Although we do not yet recommend CephFS for production deployments,
  we do encourage testing for non-critical workloads so that we can
  better gauge the feature, usability, performance, and stability
  gaps.
* *Local Recovery Codes*: the OSDs now support an erasure-coding scheme
  that stores some additional data blocks to reduce the IO required to
  recover from single OSD failures.
* *Degraded vs misplaced*: the Ceph health reports from 'ceph -s' and
  related commands now make a distinction between data that is
  degraded (there are fewer than the desired number of copies) and
  data that is misplaced (stored in the wrong location in the
  cluster).  The distinction is important because the latter does not
  compromise data safety.
* *Tiering improvements*: we have made several improvements to the
  cache tiering implementation that improve performance.  Most
  notably, objects are not promoted into the cache tier by a single
  read; they must be found to be sufficiently hot before that happens.
* *Monitor performance*: the monitors now perform writes to the local
  data store asynchronously, improving overall responsiveness.
* *Recovery tools*: the ceph_objectstore_tool is greatly expanded to
  allow manipulation of an individual OSDs data store for debugging
  and repair purposes.  This is most heavily used by our QA
  infrastructure to exercise recovery code.

Upgrade Sequencing
------------------

* If your existing cluster is running a version older than v0.80.x
  Firefly, please first upgrade to the latest Firefly release before
  moving on to Giant.  We have not tested upgrades directly from
  Emperor, Dumpling, or older releases.

  We *have* tested:

   * Firefly to Giant
   * Dumpling to Firefly to Giant

* Please upgrade daemons in the following order:

   #. Monitors
   #. OSDs
   #. MDSs and/or radosgw

  Note that the relative ordering of OSDs and monitors should not matter, but
  we primarily tested upgrading monitors first.

Upgrading from v0.80x Firefly
-----------------------------

* The client-side caching for librbd is now enabled by default (rbd
  cache = true).  A safety option (rbd cache writethrough until flush
  = true) is also enabled so that writeback caching is not used until
  the library observes a 'flush' command, indicating that the librbd
  users is passing that operation through from the guest VM.  This
  avoids potential data loss when used with older versions of qemu
  that do not support flush.

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 8*1024*1024  = 33554432   // 8MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

* The 'rados getxattr ...' command used to add a gratuitous newline to the attr
  value; it now does not.

* The ``*_kb perf`` counters on the monitor have been removed.  These are
  replaced with a new set of ``*_bytes`` counters (e.g., ``cluster_osd_kb`` is
  replaced by ``cluster_osd_bytes``).

* The ``rd_kb`` and ``wr_kb`` fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed
  via the ``ceph df detail -f json-pretty`` and related commands) have been
  replaced with corresponding ``*_bytes`` fields.  Similarly, the
  ``total_space``, ``total_used``, and ``total_avail`` fields are replaced with
  ``total_bytes``, ``total_used_bytes``,  and ``total_avail_bytes`` fields.

* The ``rados df --format=json`` output ``read_bytes`` and ``write_bytes``
  fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.

* The ``rados df --format=json`` output previously included ``read_kb`` and
  ``write_kb`` fields; these have been removed.  Please use ``read_bytes`` and
  ``write_bytes`` instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).

* The experimental keyvaluestore-dev OSD backend had an on-disk format
  change that prevents existing OSD data from being upgraded.  This
  affects developers and testers only.

* mon-specific and osd-specific leveldb options have been removed.
  From this point onward users should use the `leveldb_*` generic
  options and add the options in the appropriate sections of their
  configuration files.  Monitors will still maintain the following
  monitor-specific defaults:

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 8*1024*1024  = 33554432   // 8MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

* CephFS support for the legacy anchor table has finally been removed.
  Users with file systems created before firefly should ensure that inodes
  with multiple hard links are modified *prior* to the upgrade to ensure that
  the backtraces are written properly.  For example::

    sudo find /mnt/cephfs -type f -links +1 -exec touch \{\} \;

* We disallow nonsensical 'tier cache-mode' transitions.  From this point
  onward, 'writeback' can only transition to 'forward' and 'forward'
  can transition to 1) 'writeback' if there are dirty objects, or 2) any if
  there are no dirty objects.

v0.86
=====

This is a release candidate for Giant, which will hopefully be out
in another week or two.  We did a feature freeze about a month ago
and since then have been doing only stabilization and bug fixing (and
a handful on low-risk enhancements).  A fair bit of new functionality
went into the final sprint, but it's baked for quite a while now and
we're feeling pretty good about it.

Major items include:

* librados locking refactor to improve scaling and client performance
* local recovery code (LRC) erasure code plugin to trade some
  additional storage overhead for improved recovery performance
* LTTNG tracing framework, with initial tracepoints in librados,
  librbd, and the OSD FileStore backend
* separate monitor audit log for all administrative commands
* asynchronous monitor transaction commits to reduce the impact on
  monitor read requests while processing updates
* low-level tool for working with individual OSD data stores for
  debugging, recovery, and testing
* many MDS improvements (bug fixes, health reporting)

There are still a handful of known bugs in this release, but nothing
severe enough to prevent a release.  By and large we are pretty
pleased with the stability and expect the final Giant release to be
quite reliable.

Please try this out on your non-production clusters for a preview

v0.85
=====

This is the second-to-last development release before Giant that
contains new functionality.  The big items to land during this cycle
are the messenger refactoring from Matt Benjamin that lays some
groundwork for RDMA support, a performance improvement series from
SanDisk that improves performance on SSDs, lots of improvements to our
new standalone civetweb-based RGW frontend, and a new 'osd blocked-by'
mon command that allows admins to easily identify which OSDs are
blocking peering progress.  The other big change is that the OSDs and
Monitors now distinguish between "misplaced" and "degraded" objects:
the latter means there are fewer copies than we'd like, while the
former simply means the are not stored in the locations where we want
them to be.

Also of note is a change to librbd that enables client-side caching by
default.  This is coupled with another option that makes the cache
write-through until a "flush" operations is observed: this implies
that the librbd user (usually a VM guest OS) supports barriers and
flush and that it is safe for the cache to switch into writeback mode
without compromising data safety or integrity.  It has long been
recommended practice that these options be enabled (e.g., in OpenStack
environments) but until now it has not been the default.

We have frozen the tree for the looming Giant release, and the next
development release will be a release candidate with a final batch of
new functionality.

Upgrading
---------

* The client-side caching for librbd is now enabled by default (rbd
  cache = true).  A safety option (rbd cache writethrough until flush
  = true) is also enabled so that writeback caching is not used until
  the library observes a 'flush' command, indicating that the librbd
  users is passing that operation through from the guest VM.  This
  avoids potential data loss when used with older versions of qemu
  that do not support flush.

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 32*1024*1024  = 33554432  // 32MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

* The 'rados getxattr ...' command used to add a gratuitous newline to the attr
  value; it now does not.

v0.84
=====

The next Ceph development release is here!  This release contains
several meaty items, including some MDS improvements for journaling,
the ability to remove the CephFS file system (and name it), several
mon cleanups with tiered pools, several OSD performance branches, a
new "read forward" RADOS caching mode, a prototype Kinetic OSD
backend, and various radosgw improvements (especially with the new
standalone civetweb frontend).  And there are a zillion OSD bug
fixes. Things are looking pretty good for the Giant release that is
coming up in the next month.

Upgrading
---------

* The ``*_kb perf`` counters on the monitor have been removed.  These are
  replaced with a new set of ``*_bytes`` counters (e.g., ``cluster_osd_kb`` is
  replaced by ``cluster_osd_bytes``).

* The ``rd_kb`` and ``wr_kb`` fields in the JSON dumps for pool stats (accessed
  via the ``ceph df detail -f json-pretty`` and related commands) have been
  replaced with corresponding ``*_bytes`` fields.  Similarly, the
  ``total_space``, ``total_used``, and ``total_avail`` fields are replaced with
  ``total_bytes``, ``total_used_bytes``,  and ``total_avail_bytes`` fields.

* The ``rados df --format=json`` output ``read_bytes`` and ``write_bytes``
  fields were incorrectly reporting ops; this is now fixed.

* The ``rados df --format=json`` output previously included ``read_kb`` and
  ``write_kb`` fields; these have been removed.  Please use ``read_bytes`` and
  ``write_bytes`` instead (and divide by 1024 if appropriate).

v0.83
=====

Another Ceph development release!  This has been a longer cycle, so
there has been quite a bit of bug fixing and stabilization in this
round.  There is also a bunch of packaging fixes for RPM distros
(RHEL/CentOS, Fedora, and SUSE) and for systemd.  We've also added a new
librados-striper library from Sebastien Ponce that provides a generic
striping API for applications to code to.

Upgrading
---------

* The experimental keyvaluestore-dev OSD backend had an on-disk format
  change that prevents existing OSD data from being upgraded.  This
  affects developers and testers only.

* mon-specific and osd-specific leveldb options have been removed.
  From this point onward users should use the `leveldb_*` generic
  options and add the options in the appropriate sections of their
  configuration files.  Monitors will still maintain the following
  monitor-specific defaults:

    leveldb_write_buffer_size = 32*1024*1024  = 33554432  // 32MB
    leveldb_cache_size        = 512*1024*1204 = 536870912 // 512MB
    leveldb_block_size        = 64*1024       = 65536     // 64KB
    leveldb_compression       = false
    leveldb_log               = ""

  OSDs will still maintain the following osd-specific defaults:

    leveldb_log               = ""

v0.81
=====

This is the first development release since Firefly.  It includes a
lot of work that we delayed merging while stabilizing things.  Lots of
new functionality, as well as several fixes that are baking a bit before
getting backported.

Upgrading
---------

* CephFS support for the legacy anchor table has finally been removed.
  Users with file systems created before firefly should ensure that inodes
  with multiple hard links are modified *prior* to the upgrade to ensure that
  the backtraces are written properly.  For example::

    sudo find /mnt/cephfs -type f -links +1 -exec touch \{\} \;

* Disallow nonsensical 'tier cache-mode' transitions.  From this point
  onward, 'writeback' can only transition to 'forward' and 'forward'
  can transition to 1) 'writeback' if there are dirty objects, or 2) any if
  there are no dirty objects.
