After the Ceph Object Storage service is up and running, it can be administered
with user management, access controls, quotas, and usage tracking.

.. _radosgw-user-management:

User Management
===============

Ceph Object Storage user management refers only to users of the Ceph Object
Storage service and not to the Ceph Object Gateway as a user of the Ceph
Storage Cluster. Create a user, access key, and secret key to enable end users
to interact with Ceph Object Gateway services. Optionally, the users can belong
to `Accounts`_ for ease of management.

There are two types of user: 

- **User:** The term "user" refers to  user of the S3 interface.

- **Subuser:** The term "subuser" refers to a user of the Swift interface. A
  subuser is associated with a user. 
  
.. ditaa::
           +---------+
           | Account |
           +----+----+  
                |     
                |     +---------+
                +-----+  User   |
                      +----+----+
                           |
                           |     +-----------+
                           +-----+  Subuser  |
                                 +-----------+

Users and subusers can be created, modified, viewed, suspended and removed.
you may add a Display names and an email addresses can be added to user
profiles. Keys and secrets can either be specified or generated automatically.
When generating or specifying keys, remember that user IDs correspond to S3 key
types and subuser IDs correspond to Swift key types. 

Swift keys have access levels of ``read``, ``write``, ``readwrite`` and
``full``.


Create a User
-------------

To create a user (S3 interface), run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user create --uid={username} --display-name="{display-name}" [--email={email}]

For example:

.. prompt:: bash
	
   radosgw-admin user create --uid=johndoe --display-name="John Doe" --email=john@example.com
  
.. code-block:: javascript
  
  { "user_id": "johndoe",
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "max_buckets": 1000,
    "subusers": [],
    "keys": [
          { "user": "johndoe",
            "access_key": "11BS02LGFB6AL6H1ADMW",
            "secret_key": "vzCEkuryfn060dfee4fgQPqFrncKEIkh3ZcdOANY"}],
    "swift_keys": [],
    "caps": [],
    "op_mask": "read, write, delete",
    "default_placement": "",
    "placement_tags": [],
    "bucket_quota": { "enabled": false,
        "max_size_kb": -1,
        "max_objects": -1},
    "user_quota": { "enabled": false,
        "max_size_kb": -1,
        "max_objects": -1},
    "temp_url_keys": []}

The creation of a user entails the creation of an ``access_key`` and a
``secret_key`` entry, which can be used with any S3 API-compatible client.  

.. important:: Check the key output. Sometimes ``radosgw-admin`` generates a
   JSON escape (``\``) character, and some clients do not know how to handle
   JSON escape characters. Remedies include removing the JSON escape character
   (``\``), encapsulating the string in quotes, regenerating the key and
   ensuring that it does not have a JSON escape character, or specifying the
   key and secret manually.


Create a Subuser
----------------

To create a subuser (a user of the Swift interface) for the user, specify the
user ID (``--uid={username}``), a subuser ID, and the subuser's access level:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin subuser create --uid={uid} --subuser={uid} --access=[ read | write | readwrite | full ]

For example:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin subuser create --uid=johndoe --subuser=johndoe:swift --access=full


.. note:: ``full`` is not the same as ``readwrite``. The ``full`` access level
   includes ``read`` and ``write``, but it also includes the access control
   policy.

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "user_id": "johndoe",
    "display_name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "max_buckets": 1000,
    "subusers": [
          { "id": "johndoe:swift",
            "permissions": "full-control"}],
    "keys": [
          { "user": "johndoe",
            "access_key": "11BS02LGFB6AL6H1ADMW",
            "secret_key": "vzCEkuryfn060dfee4fgQPqFrncKEIkh3ZcdOANY"}],
    "swift_keys": [],
    "caps": [],
    "op_mask": "read, write, delete",
    "default_placement": "",
    "placement_tags": [],
    "bucket_quota": { "enabled": false,
        "max_size_kb": -1,
        "max_objects": -1},
    "user_quota": { "enabled": false,
        "max_size_kb": -1,
        "max_objects": -1},
    "temp_url_keys": []}


Get User Info
-------------

To get information about a user, specify ``user info`` and the user ID
(``--uid={username}``). Use a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user info --uid=johndoe


Modify User Info
----------------

To modify information about a user, specify the user ID (``--uid={username}``)
and the attributes that you want to modify. Typical modifications are made to
keys and secrets, email addresses, display names, and access levels. Use a
command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user modify --uid=johndoe --display-name="John E. Doe"

To modify subuser values, specify ``subuser modify``, user ID and the subuser
ID. Use a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin subuser modify --uid=johndoe --subuser=johndoe:swift --access=full


User Suspend
------------

When a user is created, the user is enabled by default. However, it is possible
to suspend user privileges and to re-enable them at a later time. To suspend a
user, specify ``user suspend`` and the user ID in a command of the following
form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user suspend --uid=johndoe

User Enable
-----------
To re-enable a suspended user, provide ``user enable`` and specify the user ID
in a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user enable --uid=johndoe
	
.. note:: Disabling the user also disables any subusers.


Remove a User
-------------

When you remove a user, you also remove any subusers associated with the user.

It is possible to remove a subuser without removing its associated user. This
is covered in the section called :ref:`Remove a Subuser <radosgw-admin-remove-a-subuser>`.

To remove a user and any subusers associated with it, use the ``user rm``
command and provide the user ID of the user to be removed. Use a command of the
following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user rm --uid=johndoe

Options include:

- **Purge Data:** The ``--purge-data`` option purges all data associated 
  with the UID.
  
- **Purge Keys:** The ``--purge-keys`` option purges all keys associated 
  with the UID.

.. _radosgw-admin-remove-a-subuser:

Remove a Subuser
----------------

Removing a subuser removes access to the Swift interface or to S3. The user
associated with the removed subuser remains in the system after the subuser's
removal. 

To remove the subuser, use the command ``subuser rm`` and provide the subuser
ID of the subuser to be removed. Use a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin subuser rm --subuser=johndoe:swift

Options include:
  
- **Purge Keys:** The ``--purge-keys`` option purges all keys associated 
  with the UID.


Add or  Remove a Key
--------------------

Both users and subusers require a key to access the S3 or Swift interface. To
use S3, the user needs a key pair which is composed of an access key and a
secret key. To use Swift, the user needs a secret key (password), which is used
together with its associated user ID. You can create a key and either specify
or generate the access key or secret key. You can also remove a key. Options
include:

- ``--key-type=<type>`` specifies the key type. The options are: ``s3``, ``swift``
- ``--access-key=<key>`` manually specifies an S3 access key.
- ``--secret-key=<key>`` manually specifies a S3 secret key or a Swift secret key.
- ``--gen-access-key`` automatically generates a random S3 access key.
- ``--gen-secret`` automatically generates a random S3 secret key or a random Swift secret key.
- ``--generate-key`` create user with or without credentials. If sets to false, then user cannot set ``gen-secret/gen-access-key/access-key/secret-key``

Adding S3 keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To add a specific S3 key pair for a user, run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin key create --uid=foo --key-type=s3 --access-key fooAccessKey --secret-key fooSecretKey

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "user_id": "foo",
    "rados_uid": 0,
    "display_name": "foo",
    "email": "foo@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "keys": [
      { "user": "foo",
        "access_key": "fooAccessKey",
        "secret_key": "fooSecretKey"}],
  }

.. note:: You can create multiple S3 key pairs for a user.

Adding Swift secret keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To attach a specific Swift secret key for a subuser, run a command of the
following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin key create --subuser=foo:bar --key-type=swift --secret-key barSecret

.. code-block:: javascript

  { "user_id": "foo",
    "rados_uid": 0,
    "display_name": "foo",
    "email": "foo@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "subusers": [
       { "id": "foo:bar",
         "permissions": "full-control"}],
    "swift_keys": [
      { "user": "foo:bar",
        "secret_key": "asfghjghghmgm"}]}

.. note:: A subuser can have only one Swift secret key.

Associating subusers with S3 key pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Subusers can also be used with S3 APIs if the subuser is associated with a S3
key pair. To associate a subuser with an S3 key pair, run a command of the
following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin key create --subuser=foo:bar --key-type=s3 --access-key barAccessKey --secret-key barSecretKey
	
.. code-block:: javascript

  { "user_id": "foo",
    "rados_uid": 0,
    "display_name": "foo",
    "email": "foo@example.com",
    "suspended": 0,
    "subusers": [
       { "id": "foo:bar",
         "permissions": "full-control"}],
    "keys": [
      { "user": "foo:bar",
        "access_key": "barAccessKey",
        "secret_key": "barSecretKey"}],
  }


Removing S3 key pairs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a S3 key pair, specify the access key to be removed. Run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin key rm --uid=foo --key-type=s3 --access-key=fooAccessKey 

Removing Swift secret keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To remove a Swift secret key, run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin key rm --subuser=foo:bar --key-type=swift


Add or Remove Admin Capabilities
--------------------------------

The Ceph Storage Cluster provides an administrative API that enables users to
execute administrative functions via the REST API. By default, users do NOT
have access to this API. To enable a user to exercise administrative
functionality, provide the user with administrative capabilities.

To add administrative capabilities to a user, run a command of the following
form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin caps add --uid={uid} --caps={caps}


You can add read, write or all capabilities to users, buckets, metadata and
usage (utilization). To do this, use a command-line option of the following
form:

.. prompt:: bash

   --caps="[users|buckets|metadata|usage|zone|amz-cache|info|bilog|mdlog|datalog|user-policy|oidc-provider|roles|ratelimit|user-info-without-keys]=[\*|read|write|read, write]"

For example:

.. prompt:: bash

	radosgw-admin caps add --uid=johndoe --caps="users=*;buckets=*"

To remove administrative capabilities from a user, run a command of the
following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin caps rm --uid=johndoe --caps={caps}
  


Quota Management
================

The Ceph Object Gateway makes it possible for you to set quotas on users and
buckets owned by users. Quotas include the maximum number of objects in a
bucket and the maximum storage size a bucket can hold.

- **Bucket:** The ``--bucket`` option allows you to specify a quota for
  buckets the user owns.

- **Maximum Objects:** The ``--max-objects`` setting allows you to specify
  the maximum number of objects. A negative value disables this setting.
  
- **Maximum Size:** The ``--max-size`` option allows you to specify a quota
  size in B/K/M/G/T, where B is the default. A negative value disables this
  setting.
  
- **Quota Scope:** The ``--quota-scope`` option sets the scope for the quota.
  The options are ``bucket`` and ``user``. Bucket quotas apply to each bucket
  owned by the user. User Quotas are summed across all buckets owned by the
  user. 


Set User Quota
--------------

Before you enable a quota, you must first set the quota parameters.
To set quota parameters, run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota set --quota-scope=user --uid=<uid> [--max-objects=<num objects>] [--max-size=<max size>]

For example:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota set --quota-scope=user --uid=johndoe --max-objects=1024 --max-size=1024B

Passing a negative value as an argument of ``--max-objects`` or ``--max-size``
disables the given quota attribute.  


Enabling and Disabling User Quota
---------------------------------

After a user quota is set, it must be enabled in order to take effect. To enable a user quota, run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota enable --quota-scope=user --uid=<uid>

To disable an enabled user quota, run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota disable --quota-scope=user --uid=<uid>


Set Bucket Quota
----------------

Bucket quotas apply to the buckets owned by the specified ``uid``. They are
independent of the user. To set a bucket quota, run a command of the following
form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota set --uid=<uid> --quota-scope=bucket [--max-objects=<num objects>] [--max-size=<max size]

A negative value for ``--max-objects`` or ``--max-size`` means that the
specific quota attribute is disabled.


Enable and Disabling Bucket Quota
---------------------------------

After a bucket quota has been set, it must be enabled in order to take effect.
To enable a bucket quota, run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota enable --quota-scope=bucket --uid=<uid>

To disable an enabled bucket quota, run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin quota disable --quota-scope=bucket --uid=<uid>


Get Quota Settings
------------------

You can access each user's quota settings via the user information
API. To read user quota setting information with the CLI interface, 
run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user info --uid=<uid>


Update Quota Stats
------------------

Quota stats are updated asynchronously. You can update quota statistics for all
users and all buckets manually to force an update of the latest quota stats. To
update quota statistics for all users and all buckets in order to retrieve the
latest quota statistics, run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user stats --uid=<uid> --sync-stats

.. _rgw_user_usage_stats:

Get User Usage Stats
--------------------

To see how much of a quota a user has consumed, run a command of the following
form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin user stats --uid=<uid>

.. note:: Run ``radosgw-admin user stats`` with the ``--sync-stats`` option to
   receive the latest data.

Default Quotas
--------------

You can set default quotas in the Ceph Object Gateway config. **These defaults
will be used only when creating new users and will have no effect on existing
users.** If a default quota is set in the Ceph Object Gateway Config, then that
quota is set for all subsequently-created users, and that quota is enabled. See
``rgw_bucket_default_quota_max_objects``,
``rgw_bucket_default_quota_max_size``, ``rgw_user_default_quota_max_objects``,
``rgw_user_default_quota_max_size``, ``rgw_account_default_quota_max_objects``,
and ``rgw_account_default_quota_max_size`` in `Ceph Object Gateway Config
Reference`_.

Quota Cache
-----------

Quota statistics are cached by each RGW instance. If multiple RGW instances are
deployed, then this cache may prevent quotas from being perfectly enforced,
because each instance may have a different set of quota settings.  

Here are the options that control this behavior: 

:confval:`rgw_bucket_quota_ttl`
:confval:`rgw_user_quota_bucket_sync_interval`
:confval:`rgw_user_quota_sync_interval`

Increasing these values will make quota operations more efficient at the cost
of increasing the likelihood that the multiple RGW instances may not
consistently have the latest quota settings. Decreasing these values brings
the multiple RGW instances closer to perfect quota synchronization. 

If all three values are set to ``0`` , then quota caching is effectively
disabled, and multiple instances will have perfect quota enforcement.  See
`Ceph Object Gateway Config Reference`_.

Reading / Writing Global Quotas
-------------------------------

You can read and write global quota settings in the period configuration. To
view the global quota settings, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin global quota get

Global quota settings can be manipulated with the ``global quota``
counterparts of the ``quota set``, ``quota enable``, and ``quota disable``
commands, as in the following examples:  

.. prompt:: bash

	radosgw-admin global quota set --quota-scope bucket --max-objects 1024
	radosgw-admin global quota enable --quota-scope bucket

.. note:: In a multisite configuration where there is a realm and period
   present, changes to the global quotas must be committed using ``period
   update --commit``. If no period is present, the RGW instances must
   be restarted for the changes to take effect.


Rate Limit Management
=====================

Quotas can be set for The Ceph Object Gateway on users and buckets. The "rate
limit" includes the maximum number of read operations (read ops) and write
operations (write ops) per minute as well as the number of bytes per minute
that can be written or read per user or per bucket.

Read Requests and Write Requests
--------------------------------
Operations that use the ``GET`` method or the ``HEAD`` method in their REST
requests are "read requests". All other requests are "write requests".  

How Metrics Work
----------------
Each object gateway tracks per-user metrics separately from bucket metrics.
These metrics are not shared with other gateways. The configured limits should
be divided by the number of active object gateways. For example, if "user A" is
to be be limited to 10 ops per minute and there are two object gateways in the
cluster, then the limit on "user A" should be ``5`` (10 ops per minute / 2
RGWs). If the requests are **not** balanced between RGWs, the rate limit might
be underutilized. For example: if the ops limit is ``5`` and there are two
RGWs, **but** the Load Balancer sends load to only one of those RGWs, the
effective limit is 5 ops, because this limit is enforced per RGW. If the rate
limit that has been set for the bucket has been reached but the rate limit that
has been set for the user has not been reached, then the request is cancelled.
The contrary holds as well: if the rate limit that has been set for the user
has been reached but the rate limit that has been set for the bucket has not
been reached, then the request is cancelled.

The accounting of bandwidth happens only after a request has been accepted.
This means that requests will proceed even if the bucket rate limit or user
rate limit is reached during the execution of the request. The RGW keeps track
of a "debt" consisting of bytes used in excess of the configured value; users
or buckets that incur this kind of debt are prevented  from sending more
requests until the "debt" has been repaid. The maximum size of the "debt" is
twice the max-read/write-bytes per minute. If "user A" is subject to a 1-byte
read limit per minute and they attempt to GET an object that is 1 GB in size,
then the ``GET`` action will fail. After "user A" has completed this 1 GB
operation, RGW blocks the user's requests for up to two minutes. After this
time has elapsed, "user A" will be able to send ``GET`` requests again.


- **Bucket:** The ``--bucket`` option allows you to specify a rate limit for a
  bucket.

- **User:** The ``--uid`` option allows you to specify a rate limit for a
  user.

- **Maximum Read Ops:** The ``--max-read-ops`` setting allows you to limit read
  bytes per minute per RGW instance. A ``0`` value disables throttling. 
  
- **Maximum Read Bytes:** The ``--max-read-bytes`` setting allows you to limit
  read bytes per minute per RGW instance. A ``0`` value disables throttling. 

- **Maximum Write Ops:** The ``--max-write-ops`` setting allows you to specify
  the maximum number of write ops per minute per RGW instance. A ``0`` value
  disables throttling.
  
- **Maximum Write Bytes:** The ``--max-write-bytes`` setting allows you to
  specify the maximum number of write bytes per minute per RGW instance. A
  ``0`` value disables throttling.
 
- **Rate Limit Scope:** The ``--ratelimit-scope`` option sets the scope for the
  rate limit.  The options are ``bucket`` , ``user`` and ``anonymous``. Bucket
  rate limit apply to buckets.  The user rate limit applies to a user.  The
  ``anonymous`` option applies to an unauthenticated user. Anonymous scope is
  available only for global rate limit.


Set User Rate Limit
-------------------

Before you can enable a rate limit, you must first set the rate limit
parameters. The following is the general form of commands that set rate limit
parameters: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope=user --uid=<uid>
   <[--max-read-ops=<num ops>] [--max-read-bytes=<num bytes>]
   [--max-write-ops=<num ops>] [--max-write-bytes=<num bytes>]>

An example of using ``radosgw-admin ratelimit set`` to set a rate limit might
look like this: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope=user --uid=johndoe --max-read-ops=1024 --max-write-bytes=10240


A value of ``0`` assigned to ``--max-read-ops``, ``--max-read-bytes``,
``--max-write-ops``, or ``--max-write-bytes`` disables the specified rate
limit.  

Get User Rate Limit
-------------------

The ``radosgw-admin ratelimit get`` command returns the currently configured
rate limit parameters.

The following is the general form of the command that returns the current
configured limit parameters:  

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit get --ratelimit-scope=user --uid=<uid>

An example of using ``radosgw-admin ratelimit get`` to return the rate limit
parameters might look like this: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit get --ratelimit-scope=user --uid=johndoe

A value of ``0`` assigned to ``--max-read-ops``, ``--max-read-bytes``,
``--max-write-ops``, or ``--max-write-bytes`` disables the specified rate
limit.  


Enable and Disable User Rate Limit
----------------------------------

After you have set a user rate limit, you must enable it in order for it to
take effect. Run a command of the following form to enable a user rate limit: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit enable --ratelimit-scope=user --uid=<uid>

To disable an enabled user rate limit, run a command of the following form: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit disable --ratelimit-scope=user --uid=johndoe


Set Bucket Rate Limit
---------------------

Before you enable a rate limit, you must first set the rate limit parameters.
The following is the general form of commands that set rate limit parameters:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope=bucket --bucket=<bucket> <[--max-read-ops=<num ops>] [--max-read-bytes=<num bytes>]
  [--max-write-ops=<num ops>] [--max-write-bytes=<num bytes>]>

An example of using ``radosgw-admin ratelimit set`` to set a rate limit for a
bucket might look like this: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope=bucket --bucket=mybucket --max-read-ops=1024 --max-write-bytes=10240


A value of ``0`` assigned to ``--max-read-ops``, ``--max-read-bytes``,
``--max-write-ops``, or ``-max-write-bytes`` disables the specified bucket rate
limit. 

Get Bucket Rate Limit
---------------------

The ``radosgw-admin ratelimit get`` command returns the current configured rate
limit parameters.

The following is the general form of the command that returns the current
configured limit parameters:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit get --ratelimit-scope=bucket --bucket=<bucket>

An example of using ``radosgw-admin ratelimit get`` to return the rate limit
parameters for a bucket might look like this:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit get --ratelimit-scope=bucket --bucket=mybucket

A value of ``0`` assigned to ``--max-read-ops``, ``--max-read-bytes``,
``--max-write-ops``, or ``--max-write-bytes`` disables the specified rate
limit.


Enable and Disable Bucket Rate Limit
------------------------------------

After you set a bucket rate limit, you can enable it. The following is the
general form of the ``radosgw-admin ratelimit enable`` command that enables
bucket rate limits: 

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit enable --ratelimit-scope=bucket --bucket=<bucket>

An enabled bucket rate limit can be disabled by running a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin ratelimit disable --ratelimit-scope=bucket --uid=mybucket

Reading and Writing Global Rate Limit Configuration
---------------------------------------------------

You can read and write global rate limit settings in the period's configuration.
To view the global rate limit settings, run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin global ratelimit get

The global rate limit settings can be manipulated with the ``global ratelimit``
counterparts of the ``ratelimit set``, ``ratelimit enable``, and ``ratelimit
disable`` commands. Per-user and per-bucket ratelimit configurations override
the global configuration:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin global ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope bucket --max-read-ops=1024
   radosgw-admin global ratelimit enable --ratelimit-scope bucket

The global rate limit can be used to configure the scope of the rate limit for
all authenticated users:

.. prompt:: bash

   radosgw-admin global ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope user --max-read-ops=1024
   radosgw-admin global ratelimit enable --ratelimit-scope user

The global rate limit can be used to configure the scope of the rate limit for
all unauthenticated users:

.. prompt:: bash
  
   radosgw-admin global ratelimit set --ratelimit-scope=anonymous --max-read-ops=1024
   radosgw-admin global ratelimit enable --ratelimit-scope=anonymous

.. note:: In a multisite configuration where a realm and a period are present,
   any changes to the global rate limit must be committed using ``period update
   --commit``. If no period is present, the rados gateway(s) must be restarted
   for the changes to take effect.

Usage
=====

The Ceph Object Gateway logs the usage of each user. You can track the usage of
each user within a specified date range.

- Add ``rgw_enable_usage_log = true`` in the ``[client.rgw]`` section of
  ``ceph.conf`` and restart the ``radosgw`` service. 

  .. note:: Until Ceph has a linkable macro that handles all the many ways that options can be set, we advise that you set ``rgw_enable_usage_log = true`` in central config or in ``ceph.conf`` and restart all RGWs.


Options include: 

- **Start Date:** The ``--start-date`` option allows you to filter usage
  stats from a specified start date and an optional start time
  (**format:** ``yyyy-mm-dd [HH:MM:SS]``).

- **End Date:** The ``--end-date`` option allows you to filter usage up
  to a particular end date and an optional end time
  (**format:** ``yyyy-mm-dd [HH:MM:SS]``). 
  
- **Log Entries:** The ``--show-log-entries`` option allows you to specify
  whether to include log entries with the usage stats 
  (options: ``true`` | ``false``).

.. note:: You can specify time to a precision of minutes and seconds, but the
   specified time is stored only with a one-hour resolution.


Show Usage
----------

To show usage statistics, use the ``radosgw-admin usage show`` command. To show
usage for a particular user, you must specify a user ID. You can also specify a
start date, end date, and whether to show log entries. The following is an example
of such a command:

.. prompt:: bash $

   radosgw-admin usage show --uid=johndoe --start-date=2012-03-01 --end-date=2012-04-01

You can show a summary of usage information for all users by omitting the user
ID, as in the following example command:

.. prompt:: bash $

   radosgw-admin usage show --show-log-entries=false


Trim Usage
----------

Usage logs can consume significant storage space, especially over time and with
heavy use. You can trim the usage logs for all users and for specific users.
You can also specify date ranges for trim operations, as in the following
example commands:

.. prompt:: bash $

   radosgw-admin usage trim --start-date=2010-01-01 --end-date=2010-12-31
   radosgw-admin usage trim --uid=johndoe	
   radosgw-admin usage trim --uid=johndoe --end-date=2013-12-31
