Bucket Logging
====================

.. versionadded:: T

.. contents::

Bucket logging provides a mechanism for logging all access to a bucket. The log
data can be used to monitor bucket activity, detect unauthorized access, get
insights into bucket usage, and use the logs as a journal for bucket
changes. The log records are stored in objects in a separate bucket and can be
analyzed later. Logging configuration is done at the bucket level and can be
enabled or disabled at any time. The log bucket can accumulate logs from
multiple buckets. It is recommended to configure a different "prefix" for each
bucket, so that the logs of different buckets will be stored in different
objects in the log bucket.

.. note::

    - The log bucket must be created before enabling logging on a bucket
    - The log bucket cannot be the same as the bucket being logged
    - The log bucket cannot have logging enabled on it
    - The log bucket cannot have any encryption set on it (including SSE-S3
      with AES-256)
    - The log bucket cannot have any compression set on it
    - The log bucket must not have RequestPayer enabled
    - Source and log buckets must be in the same zonegroup
    - Source and log buckets may belong to different accounts (with proper
      bucket policy set)
    - The log bucket may have object lock enabled with default retention period
    - The 16-byte unique ID part of the log object name is a lexicographically
      ordered random string that consists of a 10-byte counter and a 6-byte
      random alphanumeric string (or a random alphanumeric string if the
      counter is not available)

Logging Reliability
-------------------
For performance reasons, even though the log records are written to persistent
storage, the log object will appear in the log bucket only after some
configurable amount of time (or if the maximum object size of 128MB is
reached). This time (in seconds) can be set per source bucket via a Ceph
extension to the REST API, or globally via the
`rgw_bucket_logging_obj_roll_time` configuration option. If not set, the
default time is 5 minutes. Adding a log object to the log bucket is done
"lazily", meaning that if no more records are written to the object, it may
remain outside of the log bucket even after the configured time has passed. To
counter that, you can flush all logging objects on a given source bucket to log
them, regardless if enough time passed or if no more records are written to the
object. Flushing will happen automatically when logging is disabled on a
bucket, or its logging configuration is changed, or the bucket is deleted.

Standard
````````
If the logging type is set to "Standard" (the default) the log records are
written to the log bucket after the bucket operation is completed. This means
that the logging operation may fail with no indication to the client.

Journal
```````
If the logging type is set to "Journal", the records are written to the log
bucket before the bucket operation is completed. This means that if the logging
action fails, the operation is not executed and an error is returned to the
client. Some exceptions to that rule exist: the "Fails Operation" columns in
the table below indicate by "No" which operations will not fail even if logging
failed. Journal mode supports filtering out records based on matches of the
prefixes and suffixes of the logged object keys. Regular-expression matching
can also be used on these to create filters. Note that it may happen that the
log records were successfully written but the bucket operation failed, since
the logs are written.

The following operations are supported in journal mode:

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| Operation                     | Operation Name                      | Fails Operation |
+===============================+=====================================+=================+
| ``PutObject``                 | ``REST.PUT.OBJECT``                 | Yes             |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| ``DeleteObject``              | ``REST.DELETE.OBJECT``              | No              |

+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| ``PutObjectLegalHold``        | ``REST.PUT.LEGAL_HOLD``             | Yes             |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| ``PutObjectRetention``        | ``REST.PUT.RETENTION``              | Yes             |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| ``PutObjectTagging``          | ``REST.PUT.OBJECT_TAGGING``         | Yes             |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+
| ``DeleteObjectTagging``       | ``REST.DELETE.OBJECT_TAGGING``      | No              |
+-------------------------------+-------------------------------------+-----------------+

Multisite
`````````
In a multi-zone deployment, each zone uses its own log object before the
log object is added to the log bucket. After the log object is added to the
log bucket (that is, after being flushed) it is replicated to other zones.
This means that for a given time period there can be more than one log object
holding relevant log records.

Bucket Logging Policy
---------------------
On the source bucket, only its owner is allowed to enable or disable bucket
logging. For a bucket to be used as a log bucket, it must have a bucket policy
that allows that (even if the source bucket and the log bucket are owned by the
same user or account). The bucket policy must allow the `s3:PutObject` action
for the log bucket, to be performed by the `logging.s3.amazonaws.com` service
principal. The bucket policy should also specify the source bucket and account
that are expected to write logs to it. For example:

::

    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Sid": "AllowLoggingFromSourceBucket",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "Service": "logging.s3.amazonaws.com"
          },
          "Action": "s3:PutObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::log-bucket-name/prefix*",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "aws:SourceAccount": "source-account-id"
            },
            "ArnLike": {
              "aws:SourceArn": "arn:aws:s3:::source-bucket-name"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }


Bucket Logging Quota
--------------------
Bucket and user quota are applied on the log bucket. Quota is checked every
time a log record is written, and is updated when the log object is added to
the log bucket. In "Journal" mode, if the quota is exceeded, the logging
operation fails and as a result the bucket operation also fails. In "Standard"
mode, the logging operation is skipped, but the bucket operation continues.

Log Objects Key Format
----------------------

Simple
``````
has the following format:

::

  <prefix><year-month-day-hour-minute-second>-<16 bytes unique-id>

For example:

::

  fish/2024-08-06-09-40-09-0000000002AGQ6W1

Partitioned
```````````
has the following format:

::

  <prefix><source bucket owner>/<zone group>/[tenant:]<source bucket name>/<year>/<month>/<day>/<year-month-day-hour-minute-second>-<16 bytes unique-id>

For example:

::

  fish/testid/default/fish-bucket/2024/08/06/2024-08-06-10-11-18-0000000011D1FGPA

Log Records
~~~~~~~~~~~

The log records are space-separated string columns and have the following
possible formats:

Journal
```````
minimum amount of data used for journaling bucket changes (this is a Ceph
extension).

  - bucket owner (or dash if empty)
  - bucket name (or dash if empty), in the format: ``[tenant:]<bucket name>``
  - time in the following format: ``[day/month/year:hour:minute:second timezone]``
  - object key (or dash if empty)
  - operation in the following format: ``WEBSITE/REST.<HTTP method>.<resource>``
  - object size (or dash if empty)
  - version id (dash if empty or question mark if unknown)
  - eTag

For example:

::

  testid fish [06/Aug/2024:09:40:09 +0000] myfile - REST.PUT.OBJECT 4cfdfc1f58e762d3e116787cb92fac60
  testid fish [06/Aug/2024:09:40:28 +0000] myfile REST.DELETE.OBJECT 4cfdfc1f58e762d3e116787cb92fac60
