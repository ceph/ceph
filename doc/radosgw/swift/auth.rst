 Authentication
================

Swift API requests that require authentication must contain an
``X-Storage-Token`` authentication token in the request header. 
The token may be retrieved from RADOS Gateway, or from another authenticator.
To obtain a token from RADOS Gateway, you must create a user. For example:: 

    sudo radosgw-admin user create --subuser="{username}:{subusername}" --uid="{username}" 
    --display-name="{Display Name}" --key-type=swift --secret="{password}" --access=full

For details on RADOS Gateway administration, see `radosgw-admin`_. 

.. _radosgw-admin: ../../../man/8/radosgw-admin/ 

.. note::
  For those used to the Swift API this is implementing the Swift auth v1.0 API, as such
  `{username}` above is generally equivalent to a Swift `account` and `{subusername}`
  is a user under that account.

Auth Get
--------

To authenticate a user, make a request containing an ``X-Auth-User`` and a
``X-Auth-Key`` in the header.

Response Headers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The response from the server should include an ``X-Auth-Token`` value. The
