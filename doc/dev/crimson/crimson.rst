crimson
=======

Crimson is the code name of ``crimson-osd``, which is the next
generation ``ceph-osd``. It improves performance when using fast network
and storage devices, employing state-of-the-art technologies including
DPDK and SPDK. BlueStore continues to support HDDs and slower SSDs.
Crimson aims to be backward compatible with the classic ``ceph-osd``.

.. highlight:: console

Building Crimson
================

Crimson is not enabled by default. Enable it at build time by running::

  $ WITH_SEASTAR=true ./install-deps.sh
  $ ./do_cmake.sh -DWITH_SEASTAR=ON

Please note, `ASan`_ is enabled by default if Crimson is built from a source
cloned using ``git``.

.. _ASan: https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer

Testing crimson with cephadm
===============================

The Ceph CI/CD pipeline builds containers with
``crimson-osd`` substituted for ``ceph-osd``.

Once a branch at commit <sha1> has been built and is available in
``shaman``, you can deploy it using the cephadm instructions outlined
in :ref:`cephadm` with the following adaptations.

First, while performing the initial bootstrap, use the ``--image`` flag to
use a Crimson build:

.. prompt:: bash #

   cephadm --image quay.ceph.io/ceph-ci/ceph:<sha1>-crimson --allow-mismatched-release bootstrap ...

You'll likely need to supply the ``--allow-mismatched-release`` flag to
use a non-release branch.

Configure Crimson with Bluestore
================================

As Bluestore is not a Crimson native `object store backend`_,
deploying Crimson with Bluestore as the back end requires setting
one of the two following configuration options:

.. note::

   #. These two options, along with ``crimson_alien_op_num_threads``,
      can't be changed after deployment.
   #. `vstart.sh`_ sets these options using the ``--crimson-smp`` flag.


1) ``crimson_seastar_num_threads``

   In order to allow easier cluster deployments, this option can be used
   instead of setting the CPU mask manually for each OSD.

   It's recommended to let the **number of OSDs on each host** multiplied by
   ``crimson_seastar_num_threads`` to be less than the node's number of CPU
   cores (``nproc``).

   For example, for deploying two nodes with eight CPU cores and two OSDs each:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      conf:
        # Global to all OSDs
        osd:
          crimson seastar num threads: 3

   .. note::

      #. For optimal performance ``crimson_seastar_cpu_cores`` should be set instead.

2) ``crimson_seastar_cpu_cores`` and ``crimson_alien_thread_cpu_cores``.

   Explicitly set the CPU core allocation for each ``crimson-osd``
   and for the BlueStore back end. It's recommended for each set to be mutually exclusive.

   For example, for deploying two nodes with eight CPU cores and two OSDs each:

   .. code-block:: yaml

      conf:
        # Both nodes
        osd:
          crimson alien thread cpu cores: 6-7

        # First node
        osd.0:
          crimson seastar cpu cores: 0-2
        osd.1:
          crimson seastar cpu cores: 3-5

        # Second node
        osd.2:
          crimson seastar cpu cores: 0-2
        osd.3:
          crimson seastar cpu cores: 3-5

   For a single node with eight node and three OSDs:

   .. code-block:: yaml

        conf:
          osd:
            crimson alien thread cpu cores: 6-7
          osd.0:
            crimson seastar cpu cores: 0-1
          osd.1:
            crimson seastar cpu cores: 2-3
          osd.2:
            crimson seastar cpu cores: 4-5

Running Crimson
===============

.. note::
   Crimson is in a tech preview stage. 
   As you might expect, Crimson does not yet have as extensive a feature set as does ceph-osd. 
   Malfunctions including crashes and data loss are to be expected. 

Enabling Crimson
================

After building Crimson and starting your cluster, but prior to deploying OSDs, you'll need to
`Configure Crimson with Bluestore`_ and enable Crimson to
direct the default pools to be created as Crimson pools.  You can proceed by running the following after you have a running cluster:

.. note::
   `vstart.sh`_ enables crimson automatically when `--crimson` is used.

.. prompt:: bash #

   ceph config set global 'enable_experimental_unrecoverable_data_corrupting_features' crimson
   ceph osd set-allow-crimson --yes-i-really-mean-it
   ceph config set mon osd_pool_default_crimson true

The first command enables the ``crimson`` experimental feature.  

The second enables the ``allow_crimson`` OSDMap flag.  The monitor will
not allow ``crimson-osd`` to boot without that flag.

The last causes pools to be created by default with the ``crimson`` flag.
Crimson pools are restricted to operations supported by Crimson.
``Crimson-osd`` won't instantiate PGs from non-Crimson pools.

vstart.sh
=========

The following options can be used with ``vstart.sh``.

``--crimson``
    Start ``crimson-osd`` instead of ``ceph-osd``.

``--nodaemon``
    Do not daemonize the service.

``--redirect-output``
    Redirect the ``stdout`` and ``stderr`` to ``out/$type.$num.stdout``.

``--osd-args``
    Pass extra command line options to ``crimson-osd`` or ``ceph-osd``.
    This is useful for passing Seastar options to ``crimson-osd``. For
    example, one can supply ``--osd-args "--memory 2G"`` to set the amount of
    memory to use. Please refer to the output of::

      crimson-osd --help-seastar

    for additional Seastar-specific command line options.

``--crimson-smp``
    The number of cores to use for each OSD.
    If BlueStore is used, the balance of available cores
    (as determined by `nproc`) will be assigned to the object store.

``--bluestore``
    Use the alienized BlueStore as the object store backend. This is the default (see below section on the `object store backend`_ for more details)

``--cyanstore``
    Use CyanStore as the object store backend.

``--memstore``
    Use the alienized MemStore as the object store backend.

``--seastore``
    Use SeaStore as the back end object store.

``--seastore-devs``
    Specify the block device used by SeaStore.

``--seastore-secondary-devs``
    Optional.  SeaStore supports multiple devices.  Enable this feature by
    passing the block device to this option.

``--seastore-secondary-devs-type``
    Optional.  Specify the type of secondary devices.  When the secondary
    device is slower than main device passed to ``--seastore-devs``, the cold
    data in faster device will be evicted to the slower devices over time.
    Valid types include ``HDD``, ``SSD``(default), ``ZNS``, and ``RANDOM_BLOCK_SSD``
    Note secondary devices should not be faster than the main device.

To start a cluster with a single Crimson node, run::

  $  MGR=1 MON=1 OSD=1 MDS=0 RGW=0 ../src/vstart.sh \
    --without-dashboard --bluestore --crimson \
    --redirect-output

Another SeaStore example::

  $  MGR=1 MON=1 OSD=1 MDS=0 RGW=0 ../src/vstart.sh -n -x \
    --without-dashboard --seastore \
    --crimson --redirect-output \
    --seastore-devs /dev/sda \
    --seastore-secondary-devs /dev/sdb \
    --seastore-secondary-devs-type HDD

Stop this ``vstart`` cluster by running::

  $ ../src/stop.sh --crimson

Object Store Backend
====================

At the moment, ``crimson-osd`` offers both native and alienized object store
backends. The native object store backends perform IO using the SeaStar reactor.
They are:

.. describe:: cyanstore

   CyanStore is modeled after memstore in the classic OSD.

.. describe:: seastore

   Seastore is still under active development.

The alienized object store backends are backed by a thread pool, which
is a proxy of the alienstore adaptor running in Seastar. The proxy issues
requests to object stores running in alien threads, i.e., worker threads not
managed by the Seastar framework. They are:

.. describe:: memstore

   The memory backend object store

.. describe:: bluestore

   The object store used by the classic ``ceph-osd``

daemonize
---------

Unlike ``ceph-osd``, ``crimson-osd`` does not daemonize itself even if the
``daemonize`` option is enabled. In order to read this option, ``crimson-osd``
needs to ready its config sharded service, but this sharded service lives
in the Seastar reactor. If we fork a child process and exit the parent after
starting the Seastar engine, that will leave us with a single thread which is
a replica of the thread that called `fork()`_. Tackling this problem in Crimson
would unnecessarily complicate the code.

Since supported GNU/Linux distributions use ``systemd``, which is able to
daemonize processes, there is no need to daemonize ourselves. 
Those using sysvinit can use ``start-stop-daemon`` to daemonize ``crimson-osd``.
If this is does not work out, a helper utility may be devised.

.. _fork(): http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/fork.html

logging
-------

``Crimson-osd`` currently uses the logging utility offered by Seastar. See
``src/common/dout.h`` for the mapping between Ceph logging levels to
the severity levels in Seastar. For instance, messages sent to ``derr``
will be issued using ``logger::error()``, and the messages with a debug level
greater than ``20`` will be issued using ``logger::trace()``.

+---------+---------+
| ceph    | seastar |
+---------+---------+
| < 0     | error   |
+---------+---------+
|   0     | warn    |
+---------+---------+
| [1, 6)  | info    |
+---------+---------+
| [6, 20] | debug   |
+---------+---------+
| >  20   | trace   |
+---------+---------+

Note that ``crimson-osd``
does not send log messages directly to a specified ``log_file``. It writes
the logging messages to stdout and/or syslog. This behavior can be
changed using ``--log-to-stdout`` and ``--log-to-syslog`` command line
options. By default, ``log-to-stdout`` is enabled, and ``--log-to-syslog`` is disabled.
Metrics and Tracing
===================

Crimson offers three ways to report stats and metrics.

PG stats reported to mgr
------------------------

Crimson collects the per-pg, per-pool, and per-osd stats in a `MPGStats`
message which is sent to the Ceph Managers. Manager modules can query
them using the `MgrModule.get()` method.

Asock command
-------------

An admin socket command is offered for dumping metrics::

  $ ceph tell osd.0 dump_metrics
  $ ceph tell osd.0 dump_metrics reactor_utilization

Here `reactor_utilization` is an optional string allowing us to filter
the dumped metrics by prefix.

Prometheus text protocol
------------------------

The listening port and address can be configured using the command line options of
`--prometheus_port`
see `Prometheus`_ for more details.

.. _Prometheus: https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/blob/master/doc/prometheus.md

Profiling Crimson
=================

Fio
---

``crimson-store-nbd`` exposes configurable ``FuturizedStore`` internals as an
NBD server for use with ``fio``.

In order to use ``fio`` to test ``crimson-store-nbd``, perform the below steps.

#. You will need to install ``libnbd``, and compile it into ``fio``

   .. prompt:: bash $

      apt-get install libnbd-dev
      git clone git://git.kernel.dk/fio.git
      cd fio
      ./configure --enable-libnbd
      make

#. Build ``crimson-store-nbd``

   .. prompt:: bash $

      cd build
      ninja crimson-store-nbd

#. Run the ``crimson-store-nbd`` server with a block device. Specify
   the path to the raw device, for example ``/dev/nvme1n1``, in place of the created
   file for testing with a block device.

   .. prompt:: bash $

      export disk_img=/tmp/disk.img
      export unix_socket=/tmp/store_nbd_socket.sock
      rm -f $disk_img $unix_socket
      truncate -s 512M $disk_img
      ./bin/crimson-store-nbd \
        --device-path $disk_img \
        --smp 1 \
        --mkfs true \
        --type transaction_manager \
        --uds-path ${unix_socket} &

   Below are descriptions of these command line arguments:

   ``--smp``
     The number of CPU cores to use (Symmetric MultiProcessor)

   ``--mkfs``
     Initialize the device first.

   ``--type``
     The back end to use. If ``transaction_manager`` is specified, SeaStore's
     ``TransactionManager`` and ``BlockSegmentManager`` are used to emulate a
     block device. Otherwise, this option is used to choose a backend of
     ``FuturizedStore``, where the whole "device" is divided into multiple
     fixed-size objects whose size is specified by ``--object-size``. So, if
     you are only interested in testing the lower-level implementation of
     SeaStore like logical address translation layer and garbage collection
     without the object store semantics, ``transaction_manager`` would be a
     better choice.

#. Create a ``fio`` job file named ``nbd.fio``

   .. code:: ini

      [global]
      ioengine=nbd
      uri=nbd+unix:///?socket=${unix_socket}
      rw=randrw
      time_based
      runtime=120
      group_reporting
      iodepth=1
      size=512M

      [job0]
      offset=0

#. Test the Crimson object store, using the custom ``fio`` built just now

   .. prompt:: bash $

      ./fio nbd.fio

Hacking Crimson
===============


Seastar Documents
-----------------

See `Seastar Tutorial <https://github.com/scylladb/seastar/blob/master/doc/tutorial.md>`_ .
Or build a browsable version and start an HTTP server::

  $ cd seastar
  $ ./configure.py --mode debug
  $ ninja -C build/debug docs
  $ python3 -m http.server -d build/debug/doc/html

You might want to install ``pandoc`` and other dependencies beforehand.

Debugging Crimson
=================

Debugging with GDB
------------------

The `tips`_ for debugging Scylla also apply to Crimson.

.. _tips: https://github.com/scylladb/scylla/blob/master/docs/dev/debugging.md#tips-and-tricks

Human-readable backtraces with addr2line
----------------------------------------

When a Seastar application crashes, it leaves us with a backtrace of addresses, like::

  Segmentation fault.
  Backtrace:
    0x00000000108254aa
    0x00000000107f74b9
    0x00000000105366cc

    0x000000000d833ac9
  Segmentation fault

The ``seastar-addr2line`` utility provided by Seastar can be used to map these
addresses to functions. The script expects input on ``stdin``,
so we need to copy and paste the above addresses, then send EOF by inputting
``control-D`` in the terminal.  One might  use ``echo`` or ``cat`` instead::

  $ ../src/seastar/scripts/seastar-addr2line -e bin/crimson-osd

Note that ``seastar-addr2line`` is able to extract addresses from
its input, so you can also paste the log messages as below::

Unlike the classic ``ceph-osd``, Crimson does not print a human-readable backtrace when it
handles fatal signals like `SIGSEGV` or `SIGABRT`. It is also more complicated
with a stripped binary. So instead of planting a signal handler for
those signals into Crimson, we can use `script/ceph-debug-docker.sh` to map
addresses in the backtrace::

  # assuming you are under the source tree of ceph
  $ ./src/script/ceph-debug-docker.sh  --flavor crimson master:27e237c137c330ebb82627166927b7681b20d0aa centos:8
