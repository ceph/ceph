Concepts
--------

*Messenger*
   See src/msg/Messenger.h

   Handles sending and receipt of messages on behalf of the OSD.  The OSD uses
   two messengers: 

     1. cluster_messenger - handles traffic to other OSDs, monitors
     2. client_messenger - handles client traffic

	 This division allows the OSD to be configured with different interfaces for
	 client and cluster traffic.

*Dispatcher*
   See src/msg/Dispatcher.h

	 OSD implements the Dispatcher interface.  Of particular note is ms_dispatch,
	 which serves as the entry point for messages received via either the client
	 or cluster messenger.  Because there are two messengers, ms_dispatch may be
	 called from at least two threads.  The osd_lock is always held during
	 ms_dispatch.

*WorkQueue*
  See src/common/WorkQueue.h

  The WorkQueue class abstracts the process of queueing independent tasks
  for asynchronous execution.  Each OSD process contains workqueues for
  distinct tasks:

    1. OpWQ: handles ops (from clients) and subops (from other OSDs).
       Runs in the op_tp threadpool.
    2. PeeringWQ: handles peering tasks and pg map advancement
       Runs in the op_tp threadpool.
       See Peering
    3. CommandWQ: handles commands (pg query, etc)
       Runs in the command_tp threadpool.
    4. RecoveryWQ: handles recovery tasks.
       Runs in the recovery_tp threadpool.
    5. SnapTrimWQ: handles snap trimming
       Runs in the disk_tp threadpool.
       See SnapTrimmer
    6. ScrubWQ: handles primary scrub path
       Runs in the disk_tp threadpool.
       See Scrub
    7. ScrubFinalizeWQ: handles primary scrub finalize
       Runs in the disk_tp threadpool.
       See Scrub
    8. RepScrubWQ: handles replica scrub path
       Runs in the disk_tp threadpool
       See Scrub
    9. RemoveWQ: Asynchronously removes old pg directories
       Runs in the disk_tp threadpool
       See PGRemoval

*ThreadPool*
  See src/common/WorkQueue.h
  See also above.

  There are 4 OSD threadpools:

    1. op_tp: handles ops and subops
    2. recovery_tp: handles recovery tasks
    3. disk_tp: handles disk intensive tasks
    4. command_tp: handles commands

*OSDMap*
  See src/osd/OSDMap.h

  The crush algorithm takes two inputs: a picture of the cluster
  with status information about which nodes are up/down and in/out, 
  and the pgid to place.  The former is encapsulated by the OSDMap.
  Maps are numbered by *epoch* (epoch_t).  These maps are passed around
  within the OSD as std::tr1::shared_ptr<const OSDMap>.

  See MapHandling

*PG*
  See src/osd/PG.* src/osd/PrimaryLogPG.*

  Objects in rados are hashed into *PGs* and *PGs* are placed via crush onto
  OSDs.  The PG structure is responsible for handling requests pertaining to
  a particular *PG* as well as for maintaining relevant metadata and controlling
  recovery.

*OSDService*
  See src/osd/OSD.cc OSDService

  The OSDService acts as a broker between PG threads and OSD state which allows
  PGs to perform actions using OSD services such as workqueues and messengers.
  This is still a work in progress.  Future cleanups will focus on moving such
  state entirely from the OSD into the OSDService.

Overview
--------
  See src/ceph_osd.cc

  The OSD process represents one leaf device in the crush hierarchy.  There
  might be one OSD process per physical machine, or more than one if, for
  example, the user configures one OSD instance per disk.
