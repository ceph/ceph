====================
 The Ceph Community
====================

The Ceph community is an excellent source of information and help. For
operational issues with Ceph releases we recommend you `subscribe to the
ceph-users email list`_. When  you no longer want to receive emails, you can
`unsubscribe from the ceph-users email list`_.

If you have read through this guide and you have contacted ``ceph-users``,
but you haven't resolved your issue, you may contact `Inktank`_ for support.

You may also `subscribe to the ceph-devel email list`_. You should do so if
your issue is:

- Likely related to a bug
- Related to a development release package
- Related to a development testing package
- Related to your own builds

If you no longer want to receive emails from the ``ceph-devel`` email list, you
may `unsubscribe from the ceph-devel email list`_.

.. tip:: The Ceph community is growing rapidly, and community members can help
   you if you provide them with detailed information about your problem. You
   can attach your ceph configuration file, log files, CRUSH map, and other
   details (e.g., ``ceph osd tree``) to help people understand your issues.
