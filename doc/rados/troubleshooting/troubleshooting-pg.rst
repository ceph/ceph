 Troubleshooting PGs
====================

Placement Groups Never Get Clean
================================

Placement Groups (PGs) that remain in the ``active`` status, the
``active+remapped`` status or the ``active+degraded`` status and never achieve
an ``active+clean`` status might indicate a problem with the configuration of
the Ceph cluster. 

In such a situation, review the settings in the `Pool, PG and CRUSH Config
Reference`_ and make appropriate adjustments.

As a general rule, run your cluster with more than one OSD and a pool size
of greater than two object replicas.

.. _one-node-cluster:

One Node Cluster
----------------

Ceph no longer provides documentation for operating on a single node.  Systems
designed for distributed computing by definition do not run on a single node.
The mounting of client kernel modules on a single node that contains a Ceph
daemon may cause a deadlock due to issues with the Linux kernel itself (unless
VMs are used as clients). You can experiment with Ceph in a one-node
configuration, in spite of the limitations as described herein.

To create a cluster on a single node, you must change the
``osd_crush_chooseleaf_type`` setting from the default of ``1`` (meaning
``host`` or ``node``) to ``0`` (meaning ``osd``) in your Ceph configuration
file before you create your monitors and OSDs. This tells Ceph that an OSD is
permitted to place another OSD on the same host. If you are trying to set up a
single-node cluster and ``osd_crush_chooseleaf_type`` is greater than ``0``,
Ceph will attempt to place the PGs of one OSD with the PGs of another OSD on
another node, chassis, rack, row, or datacenter depending on the setting.

.. tip:: DO NOT mount kernel clients directly on the same node as your Ceph
   Storage Cluster. Kernel conflicts can arise. However, you can mount kernel
   clients within virtual machines (VMs) on a single node.

If you are creating OSDs using a single disk, you must manually create
directories for the data first.


Fewer OSDs than Replicas
------------------------

If two OSDs are in an ``up`` and ``in`` state, but the placement gropus are not
in an ``active + clean`` state, you may have an ``osd_pool_default_size`` set
to greater than ``2``.

There are a few ways to address this situation. If you want to operate your
cluster in an ``active + degraded`` state with two replicas, you can set the
``osd_pool_default_min_size`` to ``2`` so that you can write objects in an
``active + degraded`` state. You may also set the ``osd_pool_default_size``
setting to ``2`` so that you have only two stored replicas (the original and
one replica). In such a case, the cluster should achieve an ``active + clean``
state.

.. note:: You can make the changes while the cluster is running. If you make
   the changes in your Ceph configuration file, you might need to restart your
   cluster.


Pool Size = 1
-------------

If you have ``osd_pool_default_size`` set to ``1``, you will have only one copy
of the object. OSDs rely on other OSDs to tell them which objects they should
have. If one OSD has a copy of an object and there is no second copy, then
there is no second OSD to tell the first OSD that it should have that copy. For
each placement group mapped to the first OSD (see ``ceph pg dump``), you can
force the first OSD to notice the placement groups it needs by running a
command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph osd force-create-pg <pgid>


CRUSH Map Errors
----------------

If any placement groups in your cluster are unclean, then there might be errors
in your CRUSH map.


Stuck Placement Groups
======================

It is normal for placement groups to enter "degraded" or "peering" states after
a component failure. Normally, these states reflect the expected progression
through the failure recovery process. However, a placement group that stays in
one of these states for a long time might be an indication of a larger problem.
For this reason, the Ceph Monitors will warn when placement groups get "stuck"
in a non-optimal state. Specifically, we check for:

* ``inactive`` - The placement group has not been ``active`` for too long (that
  is, it hasn't been able to service read/write requests).

* ``unclean`` - The placement group has not been ``clean`` for too long (that
  is, it hasn't been able to completely recover from a previous failure).

* ``stale`` - The placement group status has not been updated by a
  ``ceph-osd``.  This indicates that all nodes storing this placement group may
  be ``down``.

List stuck placement groups by running one of the following commands:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph pg dump_stuck stale
   ceph pg dump_stuck inactive
   ceph pg dump_stuck unclean

- Stuck ``stale`` placement groups usually indicate that key ``ceph-osd``
  daemons are not running.
- Stuck ``inactive`` placement groups usually indicate a peering problem (see
  :ref:`failures-osd-peering`).
- Stuck ``unclean`` placement groups usually indicate that something is
  preventing recovery from completing, possibly unfound objects (see
  :ref:`failures-osd-unfound`);



.. _failures-osd-peering:

Placement Group Down - Peering Failure
======================================

In certain cases, the ``ceph-osd`` `peering` process can run into problems,
which can prevent a PG from becoming active and usable. In such a case, running
the command ``ceph health detail`` will report something similar to the following:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph health detail

::

    HEALTH_ERR 7 pgs degraded; 12 pgs down; 12 pgs peering; 1 pgs recovering; 6 pgs stuck unclean; 114/3300 degraded (3.455%); 1/3 in osds are down
    ...
    pg 0.5 is down+peering
    pg 1.4 is down+peering
    ...
    osd.1 is down since epoch 69, last address 192.168.106.220:6801/8651

Query the cluster to determine exactly why the PG is marked ``down`` by running a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph pg 0.5 query

.. code-block:: javascript

 { "state": "down+peering",
   ...
   "recovery_state": [
        { "name": "Started\/Primary\/Peering\/GetInfo",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 14:40:16.169679",
          "requested_info_from": []},
        { "name": "Started\/Primary\/Peering",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 14:40:16.169659",
          "probing_osds": [
                0,
                1],
          "blocked": "peering is blocked due to down osds",
          "down_osds_we_would_probe": [
                1],
          "peering_blocked_by": [
                { "osd": 1,
                  "current_lost_at": 0,
                  "comment": "starting or marking this osd lost may let us proceed"}]},
        { "name": "Started",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 14:40:16.169513"}
    ]
 }

The ``recovery_state`` section tells us that peering is blocked due to down
``ceph-osd`` daemons, specifically ``osd.1``. In this case, we can start that
particular ``ceph-osd`` and recovery will proceed.

Alternatively, if there is a catastrophic failure of ``osd.1`` (for example, if
there has been a disk failure), the cluster can be informed that the OSD is
``lost`` and the cluster can be instructed that it must cope as best it can.

.. important:: Informing the cluster that an OSD has been lost is dangerous
   because the cluster cannot guarantee that the other copies of the data are
   consistent and up to date.

To report an OSD ``lost`` and to instruct Ceph to continue to attempt recovery
anyway, run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph osd lost 1

Recovery will proceed.


.. _failures-osd-unfound:

Unfound Objects
===============

Under certain combinations of failures, Ceph may complain about ``unfound``
objects, as in this example:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph health detail

::

   HEALTH_WARN 1 pgs degraded; 78/3778 unfound (2.065%)
   pg 2.4 is active+degraded, 78 unfound

This means that the storage cluster knows that some objects (or newer copies of
existing objects) exist, but it hasn't found copies of them.  Here is an
example of how this might come about for a PG whose data is on two OSDS, which
we will call "1" and "2":

* 1 goes down
* 2 handles some writes, alone
* 1 comes up
* 1 and 2 re-peer, and the objects missing on 1 are queued for recovery.
* Before the new objects are copied, 2 goes down.

At this point, 1 knows that these objects exist, but there is no live
``ceph-osd`` that has a copy of the objects. In this case, IO to those objects
will block, and the cluster will hope that the failed node comes back soon.
This is assumed to be preferable to returning an IO error to the user.

.. note:: The situation described immediately above is one reason that setting
   ``size=2`` on a replicated pool and ``m=1`` on an erasure coded pool risks
   data loss.

Identify which objects are unfound by running a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph pg 2.4 list_unfound [starting offset, in json]

.. code-block:: javascript

  {
    "num_missing": 1,
    "num_unfound": 1,
    "objects": [
        {
            "oid": {
                "oid": "object",
                "key": "",
                "snapid": -2,
                "hash": 2249616407,
                "max": 0,
                "pool": 2,
                "namespace": ""
            },
            "need": "43'251",
            "have": "0'0",
            "flags": "none",
            "clean_regions": "clean_offsets: [], clean_omap: 0, new_object: 1",
            "locations": [
                "0(3)",
                "4(2)"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "state": "NotRecovering",
    "available_might_have_unfound": true,
    "might_have_unfound": [
        {
            "osd": "2(4)",
            "status": "osd is down"
        }
    ],
    "more": false
  }

If there are too many objects to list in a single result, the ``more`` field
will be true and you can query for more.  (Eventually the command line tool
will hide this from you, but not yet.)

Now you can identify which OSDs have been probed or might contain data.

At the end of the listing (before ``more: false``), ``might_have_unfound`` is
provided when ``available_might_have_unfound`` is true.  This is equivalent to
the output of ``ceph pg #.# query``.  This eliminates the need to use ``query``
directly.  The ``might_have_unfound`` information given behaves the same way as
that ``query`` does, which is described below.  The only difference is that
OSDs that have the status of ``already probed`` are ignored.

Use of ``query``:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph pg 2.4 query

.. code-block:: javascript

   "recovery_state": [
        { "name": "Started\/Primary\/Active",
          "enter_time": "2012-03-06 15:15:46.713212",
          "might_have_unfound": [
                { "osd": 1,
                  "status": "osd is down"}]},

In this case, the cluster knows that ``osd.1`` might have data, but it is
``down``. Here is the full range of possible states:

* already probed
* querying
* OSD is down
* not queried (yet)

Sometimes it simply takes some time for the cluster to query possible
locations.

It is possible that there are other locations where the object might exist that
are not listed. For example: if an OSD is stopped and taken out of the cluster
and then the cluster fully recovers, and then through a subsequent set of
failures the cluster ends up with an unfound object, the cluster will ignore
the removed OSD. (This scenario, however, is unlikely.)

If all possible locations have been queried and objects are still lost, you may
have to give up on the lost objects. This, again, is possible only when unusual
combinations of failures have occurred that allow the cluster to learn about
writes that were performed before the writes themselves have been recovered. To
mark the "unfound" objects as "lost", run a command of the following form:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph pg 2.5 mark_unfound_lost revert|delete

Here the final argument (``revert|delete``) specifies how the cluster should
deal with lost objects.

The ``delete`` option will cause the cluster to forget about them entirely.

The ``revert`` option (which is not available for erasure coded pools) will
either roll back to a previous version of the object or (if it was a new
object) forget about the object entirely. Use ``revert`` with caution, as it
may confuse applications that expect the object to exist.

Homeless Placement Groups
=========================

It is possible that every OSD that has copies of a given placement group fails.
If this happens, then the subset of the object store that contains those
placement groups becomes unavailable and the monitor will receive no status
updates for those placement groups. The monitor marks as ``stale`` any
placement group whose primary OSD has failed. For example:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph health

::

    HEALTH_WARN 24 pgs stale; 3/300 in osds are down

Identify which placement groups are ``stale`` and which were the last OSDs to
store the ``stale`` placement groups by running the following command:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph health detail

::

   HEALTH_WARN 24 pgs stale; 3/300 in osds are down
   ...
   pg 2.5 is stuck stale+active+remapped, last acting [2,0]
   ...
   osd.10 is down since epoch 23, last address 192.168.106.220:6800/11080
   osd.11 is down since epoch 13, last address 192.168.106.220:6803/11539
   osd.12 is down since epoch 24, last address 192.168.106.220:6806/11861

This output indicates that placement group 2.5 (``pg 2.5``) was last managed by
``osd.0`` and ``osd.2``. Restart those OSDs to allow the cluster to recover
that placement group.


Only a Few OSDs Receive Data
============================

If only a few of the nodes in the cluster are receiving data, check the number
of placement groups in the pool as instructed in the :ref:`Placement Groups
<rados_ops_pgs_get_pg_num>` documentation. Since placement groups get mapped to
OSDs in an operation involving dividing the number of placement groups in the
cluster by the number of OSDs in the cluster, a small number of placement
groups (the remainder, in this operation) are sometimes not distributed across
the cluster. In situations like this, create a pool with a placement group
count that is a multiple of the number of OSDs. See `Placement Groups`_ for
details. See the :ref:`Pool, PG, and CRUSH Config Reference
<rados_config_pool_pg_crush_ref>` for instructions on changing the default
values used to determine how many placement groups are assigned to each pool.


Can't Write Data
================

If the cluster is up, but some OSDs are down and you cannot write data, make
sure that you have the minimum number of OSDs running in the pool. If you don't
have the minimum number of OSDs running in the pool, Ceph will not allow you to
write data to it because there is no guarantee that Ceph can replicate your
data. See ``osd_pool_default_min_size`` in the :ref:`Pool, PG, and CRUSH
Config Reference <rados_config_pool_pg_crush_ref>` for details.


PGs Inconsistent
================

If the command ``ceph health detail`` returns an ``active + clean +
inconsistent`` state, this might indicate an error during scrubbing. Identify
the inconsistent placement group or placement groups by running the following
command:

.. prompt:: bash

    $ ceph health detail

::

    HEALTH_ERR 1 pgs inconsistent; 2 scrub errors
    pg 0.6 is active+clean+inconsistent, acting [0,1,2]
    2 scrub errors

Alternatively, run this command if you prefer to inspect the output in a
programmatic way:

.. prompt:: bash

   $ rados list-inconsistent-pg rbd

::

    ["0.6"]

There is only one consistent state, but in the worst case, we could have
different inconsistencies in multiple perspectives found in more than one
object. If an object named ``foo`` in PG ``0.6`` is truncated, the output of
``rados list-inconsistent-pg rbd`` will look something like this:

.. prompt:: bash

   rados list-inconsistent-obj 0.6 --format=json-pretty

.. code-block:: javascript

    {
        "epoch": 14,
        "inconsistents": [
            {
                "object": {
                    "name": "foo",
                    "nspace": "",
                    "locator": "",
                    "snap": "head",
                    "version": 1
                },
                "errors": [
                    "data_digest_mismatch",
                    "size_mismatch"
                ],
                "union_shard_errors": [
                    "data_digest_mismatch_info",
                    "size_mismatch_info"
                ],
                "selected_object_info": "0:602f83fe:::foo:head(16'1 client.4110.0:1 dirty|data_digest|omap_digest s 968 uv 1 dd e978e67f od ffffffff alloc_hint [0 0 0])",
                "shards": [
                    {
                        "osd": 0,
                        "errors": [],
                        "size": 968,
                        "omap_digest": "0xffffffff",
                        "data_digest": "0xe978e67f"
                    },
                    {
                        "osd": 1,
                        "errors": [],
                        "size": 968,
                        "omap_digest": "0xffffffff",
                        "data_digest": "0xe978e67f"
                    },
                    {
                        "osd": 2,
                        "errors": [
                            "data_digest_mismatch_info",
                            "size_mismatch_info"
                        ],
                        "size": 0,
                        "omap_digest": "0xffffffff",
                        "data_digest": "0xffffffff"
                    }
                ]
            }
        ]
    }

In this case, the output indicates the following:

* The only inconsistent object is named ``foo``, and its head has
  inconsistencies.
* The inconsistencies fall into two categories:

  #. ``errors``: these errors indicate inconsistencies between shards, without
     an indication of which shard(s) are bad. Check for the ``errors`` in the
     ``shards`` array, if available, to pinpoint the problem.

     * ``data_digest_mismatch``: the digest of the replica read from ``OSD.2``
       is different from the digests of the replica reads of ``OSD.0`` and
       ``OSD.1``
     * ``size_mismatch``: the size of the replica read from ``OSD.2`` is ``0``,
       but the size reported by ``OSD.0`` and ``OSD.1`` is ``968``.

  #. ``union_shard_errors``: the union of all shard-specific ``errors`` in the
     ``shards`` array. The ``errors`` are set for the shard with the problem.
     These errors include ``read_error`` and other similar errors. The
     ``errors`` ending in ``oi`` indicate a comparison with
     ``selected_object_info``. Examine the ``shards`` array to determine
     which shard has which error or errors.

     * ``data_digest_mismatch_info``: the digest stored in the ``object-info``
       is not ``0xffffffff``, which is calculated from the shard read from
       ``OSD.2``
     * ``size_mismatch_info``: the size stored in the ``object-info`` is
       different from the size read from ``OSD.2``. The latter is ``0``.

.. warning:: If ``read_error`` is listed in a shard's ``errors`` attribute, the
   inconsistency is likely due to physical storage errors. In cases like this,
   check the storage used by that OSD. 
   
   Examine the output of ``dmesg`` and ``smartctl`` before attempting a drive
   repair.

To repair the inconsistent placement group, run a command of the following
form:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph pg repair {placement-group-ID}

For example:

.. prompt:: bash #

   ceph pg repair 1.4
    
.. warning: This command overwrites the "bad" copies with "authoritative"
   copies. In most cases, Ceph is able to choose authoritative copies from all
   the available replicas by using some predefined criteria. This, however,
   does not work in every case. For example, it might be the case that the
   stored data digest is missing, which means that the calculated digest is
   ignored when Ceph chooses the authoritative copies. Be aware of this, and
   use the above command with caution.

.. note:: PG IDs have the form ``N.xxxxx``, where ``N`` is the number of the
   pool that contains the PG. The command ``ceph osd listpools`` and the
   command ``ceph osd dump | grep pool`` return a list of pool numbers.


If you receive ``active + clean + inconsistent`` states periodically due to
clock skew, consider configuring the `NTP
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol>`_ daemons on your monitor
hosts to act as peers. See `The Network Time Protocol <http://www.ntp.org>`_
and Ceph :ref:`Clock Settings <mon-config-ref-clock>` for more information.

More Information on PG Repair
-----------------------------
Ceph stores and updates the checksums of objects stored in the cluster. When a
scrub is performed on a PG, the lead OSD attempts to choose an authoritative
copy from among its replicas. Only one of the possible cases is consistent.
After performing a deep scrub, Ceph calculates the checksum of each object that
is read from disk and compares it to the checksum that was previously recorded.
If the current checksum and the previously recorded checksum do not match, that
mismatch is considered to be an inconsistency. In the case of replicated pools,
any mismatch between the checksum of any replica of an object and the checksum
of the authoritative copy means that there is an inconsistency. The discovery
of these inconsistencies cause a PG's state to be set to ``inconsistent``.

The ``pg repair`` command attempts to fix inconsistencies of various kinds. When 
``pg repair`` finds an inconsistent PG, it attempts to overwrite the digest of
the inconsistent copy with the digest of the authoritative copy. When ``pg
repair`` finds an inconsistent copy in a replicated pool, it marks the
inconsistent copy as missing. In the case of replicated pools, recovery is
beyond the scope of ``pg repair``.

In the case of erasure-coded and BlueStore pools, Ceph will automatically
perform repairs if ``osd_scrub_auto_repair`` (default ``false``) is set to
``true`` and if no more than ``osd_scrub_auto_repair_num_errors`` (default
``5``) errors are found.

The ``pg repair`` command will not solve every problem. Ceph does not
automatically repair PGs when they are found to contain inconsistencies.

The checksum of a RADOS object or an omap is not always available. Checksums
are calculated incrementally. If a replicated object is updated
non-sequentially, the write operation involved in the update changes the object
and invalidates its checksum. The whole object is not read while the checksum
is recalculated. The ``pg repair`` command is able to make repairs even when
checksums are not available to it, as in the case of Filestore. Users working
with replicated Filestore pools might prefer manual repair to ``ceph pg
repair``.

This material is relevant for Filestore, but not for BlueStore, which has its
own internal checksums. The matched-record checksum and the calculated checksum
cannot prove that any specific copy is in fact authoritative. If there is no
checksum available, ``pg repair`` favors the data on the primary, but this
might not be the uncorrupted replica. Because of this uncertainty, human
intervention is necessary when an inconsistency is discovered. This
intervention sometimes involves use of ``ceph-objectstore-tool``.

PG Repair Walkthrough
---------------------
https://ceph.io/geen-categorie/ceph-manually-repair-object/ - This page
contains a walkthrough of the repair of a PG. It is recommended reading if you
want to repair a PG but have never done so.

Erasure Coded PGs are not active+clean
======================================

If CRUSH fails to find enough OSDs to map to a PG, it will show as a
``2147483647`` which is ``ITEM_NONE`` or ``no OSD found``. For example::

     [2,1,6,0,5,8,2147483647,7,4]

Not enough OSDs
---------------

If the Ceph cluster has only eight OSDs and an erasure coded pool needs nine
OSDs, the cluster will show "Not enough OSDs". In this case, you either create
another erasure coded pool that requires fewer OSDs, by running commands of the
following form:

.. prompt:: bash

     ceph osd erasure-code-profile set myprofile k=5 m=3
     ceph osd pool create erasurepool erasure myprofile

or add new OSDs, and the PG will automatically use them.

CRUSH constraints cannot be satisfied
-------------------------------------

If the cluster has enough OSDs, it is possible that the CRUSH rule is imposing
constraints that cannot be satisfied. If there are ten OSDs on two hosts and
the CRUSH rule requires that no two OSDs from the same host are used in the
same PG, the mapping may fail because only two OSDs will be found. Check the
constraint by displaying ("dumping") the rule, as shown here:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph osd crush rule ls

::

    [
        "replicated_rule",
        "erasurepool"]
    $ ceph osd crush rule dump erasurepool
    { "rule_id": 1,
      "rule_name": "erasurepool",
      "type": 3,
      "steps": [
            { "op": "take",
              "item": -1,
              "item_name": "default"},
            { "op": "chooseleaf_indep",
              "num": 0,
              "type": "host"},
            { "op": "emit"}]}


Resolve this problem by creating a new pool in which PGs are allowed to have
OSDs residing on the same host by running the following commands:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph osd erasure-code-profile set myprofile crush-failure-domain=osd
   ceph osd pool create erasurepool erasure myprofile

CRUSH gives up too soon
-----------------------

If the Ceph cluster has just enough OSDs to map the PG (for instance a cluster
with a total of nine OSDs and an erasure coded pool that requires nine OSDs per
PG), it is possible that CRUSH gives up before finding a mapping. This problem
can be resolved by:

* lowering the erasure coded pool requirements to use fewer OSDs per PG (this
  requires the creation of another pool, because erasure code profiles cannot
  be modified dynamically).

* adding more OSDs to the cluster (this does not require the erasure coded pool
  to be modified, because it will become clean automatically)

* using a handmade CRUSH rule that tries more times to find a good mapping.
  This can be modified for an existing CRUSH rule by setting
  ``set_choose_tries`` to a value greater than the default.

First, verify the problem by using  ``crushtool`` after extracting the crushmap
from the cluster. This ensures that your experiments do not modify the Ceph
cluster and that they operate only on local files:

.. prompt:: bash

   ceph osd crush rule dump erasurepool

::

    { "rule_id": 1,
      "rule_name": "erasurepool",
      "type": 3,
      "steps": [
            { "op": "take",
              "item": -1,
              "item_name": "default"},
            { "op": "chooseleaf_indep",
              "num": 0,
              "type": "host"},
            { "op": "emit"}]}
    $ ceph osd getcrushmap > crush.map
    got crush map from osdmap epoch 13
    $ crushtool -i crush.map --test --show-bad-mappings \
       --rule 1 \
       --num-rep 9 \
       --min-x 1 --max-x $((1024 * 1024))
    bad mapping rule 8 x 43 num_rep 9 result [3,2,7,1,2147483647,8,5,6,0]
    bad mapping rule 8 x 79 num_rep 9 result [6,0,2,1,4,7,2147483647,5,8]
    bad mapping rule 8 x 173 num_rep 9 result [0,4,6,8,2,1,3,7,2147483647]

Here, ``--num-rep`` is the number of OSDs that the erasure code CRUSH rule
needs, ``--rule`` is the value of the ``rule_id`` field that was displayed by
``ceph osd crush rule dump``. This test will attempt to map one million values
(in this example, the range defined by ``[--min-x,--max-x]``) and must display
at least one bad mapping. If this test outputs nothing, all mappings have been
successful and you can be assured that the problem with your cluster is not
caused by bad mappings.

Changing the value of set_choose_tries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Decompile the CRUSH map to edit the CRUSH rule by running the following
   command:

   .. prompt:: bash

      crushtool --decompile crush.map > crush.txt

#. Add the following line to the rule::

      step set_choose_tries 100

   The relevant part of the ``crush.txt`` file will resemble this::

      rule erasurepool {
              id 1
              type erasure
              step set_chooseleaf_tries 5
              step set_choose_tries 100
              step take default
              step chooseleaf indep 0 type host
              step emit
      }

#. Recompile and retest the CRUSH rule:

   .. prompt:: bash

      crushtool --compile crush.txt -o better-crush.map

#. When all mappings succeed, display a histogram of the number of tries that
   were necessary to find all of the mapping by using the
   ``--show-choose-tries`` option of the ``crushtool`` command, as in the
   following example:

   .. prompt:: bash

      crushtool -i better-crush.map --test --show-bad-mappings \
       --show-choose-tries \
       --rule 1 \
       --num-rep 9 \
       --min-x 1 --max-x $((1024 * 1024))

   This output indicates that it took eleven tries to map forty-two PGs, twelve
   tries to map forty-four PGs etc. The highest number of tries is the minimum
   value of ``set_choose_tries`` that prevents bad mappings (for example,
   ``103`` in the above output, because it did not take more than 103 tries for
   any PG to be mapped).
