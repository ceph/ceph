clusters/    - some predefined cluster layouts
suites/      - sets of collections

We have several collections, each a subdirectory within suites/*/.
Each collection directory consists of a set facets.  The basic idea is
that, for each collection, the set of tests to run consists of all
combinations of taking one yaml fragment from each facet.

For example, given the files

  suite/collection/
  suite/collection/foo/
  suite/collection/foo/clusters/
  suite/collection/foo/clusters/fixed-3.yaml
  suite/collection/foo/clusters/fixed-9.yaml
  suite/collection/foo/tasks/
  suite/collection/foo/tasks/a
  suite/collection/foo/tasks/b
  suite/collection/foo/tasks/c
  suite/collection/bar/
  suite/collection/bar/clusters/fixed-3.yaml
  suite/collection/bar/tasks/
  suite/collection/bar/tasks/d
  suite/collection/bar/tasks/e

teuthology-suite would run tasks a, b, and c on both fixed-3 and
fixed-9 clusters.  It would also run tasks d and e on the fixed-3
cluster.

Note that the 'clusters' and 'tasks' terminology is actually
meaningless here.  All teuthology-suite does is stick the yaml
fragments together (one from each facet) and run teuthology on the
result (optionally combined with any additional fragments passed on
the command line).

In practice, we can keep common/shared task and cluster definitions in
the top-level clusters/ (which are otherwise ignored), and symlink to
them from the collections that want to use them.
