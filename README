Building Ceph
=============

To prepare the source tree after it has been git cloned,

	$ git submodule update --init

To build the server daemons, and FUSE client, execute the following:

	$ ./autogen.sh
	$ ./configure
	$ make

(Note that the FUSE client will only be built if libfuse is present.)

Dependencies
------------

The configure script will complain about any missing dependencies as
it goes.  You can also refer to debian/control or ceph.spec.in for the
package build dependencies on those platforms.  In many cases,
dependencies can be avoided with --with-foo or --without-bar switches.
For example,

$ ./configure --with-nss         # use libnss instead of libcrypto++
$ ./configure --without-radosgw  # do not build radosgw and avoid libfcgi-dev
$ ./configure --without-tcmalloc # avoid google-perftools dependency


Building packages
-----------------

You can build packages for Debian or Debian-derived (e.g., Ubuntu)
systems with

$ sudo apt-get install dpkg-dev
$ dpkg-checkbuilddeps        # make sure we have all dependencies
$ dpkg-buildpackage

For RPM-based systems (Redhat, Suse, etc.),

$ rpmbuild


Building the Documentation
==========================

Prerequisites
-------------
To build the documentation, you must install the following:

- python-dev
- python-pip
- python-virtualenv
- doxygen
- ditaa
- libxml2-dev
- libxslt-dev
- dot
- graphviz

For example:

	sudo apt-get install python-dev python-pip python-virtualenv doxygen ditaa libxml2-dev libxslt-dev dot graphviz

Building the Documentation
--------------------------

To build the documentation, ensure that you are in the top-level `/ceph directory, and execute the build script. For example:

	$ admin/build-doc
