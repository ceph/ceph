Building Ceph
-------------

To prepare the source tree for the first time in case it has been git cloned,

$ git submodule update --init

To build the server daemons, and FUSE client,

$ ./autogen.sh
$ ./configure
$ make

(Note that the FUSE client will only be built if libfuse is present.)


Dependencies
------------

The configure script will complain about any missing dependencies as
it goes.  You can also refer to debian/control or ceph.spec.in for the
package build dependencies on those platforms.  In many cases,
dependencies can be avoided with --with-foo or --without-bar switches.
For example,

$ ./configure --with-nss         # use libnss instead of libcrypto++
$ ./configure --without-radosgw  # do not build radosgw and avoid libfcgi-dev
$ ./configure --without-tcmalloc # avoid google-perftools dependency


Building packages
-----------------

You can build packages for Debian or Debian-derived (e.g., Ubuntu)
systems with

$ sudo apt-get dpkg-dev
$ dpkg-checkbuilddeps        # make sure we have all dependencies
$ dpkg-buildpackage

For RPM-based systems (Redhat, Suse, etc.),

$ rpmbuild
