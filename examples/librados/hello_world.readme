This simple librados program can be built by running "make" (and cleaned up
with "make clean"), assuming you have librados-dev already installed.

By default, the makefile will build against the librados headers and library in your
build tree (ie. using relative paths). If you would like to build the examples against
your system librados and headers, use "make all-system".

And executed using
./hello_world_cpp -c ../../src/ceph.conf
(or whatever path to a ceph.conf is appropriate to you, or
by explicitly specifying monitors, user id, and keys).

It demonstrates using librados in a non-Ceph project and the code should
be self-explanatory.
