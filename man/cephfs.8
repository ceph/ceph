.SH LIMITATIONS
.sp
When setting layout data, the specified object size must evenly divide
by the specified stripe unit. Any parameters you don\(aqt set
explicitly are left at the system defaults.
.sp
Obviously setting the layout of a file and a directory means different
things. Setting the layout of a file specifies exactly how to place
the individual file. This must be done before writing \fIany\fP data to
it. Truncating a file does not allow you to change the layout either.
.sp
Setting the layout of a directory sets the "default layout", which is
used to set the file layouts on any files subsequently created in the
directory (or any subdirectory).  Pre\-existing files do not have their
layouts changed.
.sp
You\(aqll notice that the layout information allows you to specify a
preferred OSD for placement. This feature is unsupported and ignored
in modern versions of the Ceph servers; do not use it.
.SH AVAILABILITY
