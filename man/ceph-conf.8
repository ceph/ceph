.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
\fBceph\-conf\fP is a utility for getting information about a ceph
configuration file. As with most Ceph programs, you can specify which
Ceph configuration file to use with the \fB\-c\fP flag.
.SH ACTIONS
.sp
\fBceph\-conf\fP will perform one of the following actions:
.sp
\-\-list\-all\-sections or \-L prints out a list of all the section names in the configuration
file.
.sp
\-\-list\-sections or \-l prints out a list of all the sections that begin
with a given prefix. For example, \-\-list\-sections mon would list all
sections beginning with mon.
.sp
\-\-lookup will search the configuration for a given value.  By default, the sections  that
are searched are determined by the Ceph name that we are using. The Ceph name defaults to
client.admin. It can be specified with \-\-name.
.sp
For example, if we specify  \-\-name  osd.0,  the  following  sections  will  be  searched:
[osd.0], [osd], [global]
.sp
You  can  specify  additional  sections to search with \-\-section or \-s.  These additional
sections will be searched before the sections that would normally be searched. As always,
the first matching entry we find will be returned.
.sp
Note:  \-\-lookup is the default action. If no other actions are given on the command line,
we will default to doing a lookup.
.SH EXAMPLES
.sp
To find out what value osd 0 will use for the "osd data" option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-conf \-c foo.conf  \-\-name osd.0 \-\-lookup "osd data"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To find out what value will mds a use for the "log file" option:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-conf \-c foo.conf  \-\-name mds.a "log file"
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To list all sections that begin with osd:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-conf \-c foo.conf \-l osd
.ft P
.fi
.sp
To list all sections:
.sp
.nf
.ft C
ceph\-conf \-c foo.conf \-L
.ft P
.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
