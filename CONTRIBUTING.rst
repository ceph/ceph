Performance enhancements must come with test data and detailed
explanations.

Code cleanup is appreciated along with a patch that fixes a bug or
implements a feature. Except on rare occasions, code cleanup that only
involve coding style or whitespace modifications are discouraged,
primarily because they cause problems when rebasing and backporting.
