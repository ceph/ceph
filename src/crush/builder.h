 *
 * Set the __pos__ step of the __rule__ to an operand and up to two arguments.
 * The value of the operand __op__ determines if the arguments are used and how:
 *
 * - __CRUSH_RULE_NOOP__ do nothing.
 * - __CRUSH_RULE_TAKE__ select the __arg1__ item
 * - __CRUSH_RULE_EMIT__ append the selection to the results and clear
 *     the selection
 *
 * - __CRUSH_RULE_CHOOSE_FIRSTN__ and __CRUSH_RULE_CHOOSE_INDEP__
 *     recursively explore each bucket currently selected, looking for
 *     __arg1__ items of type __arg2__ and select them.
 * - __CRUSH_RULE_CHOOSELEAF_FIRSTN__ and __CRUSH_RULE_CHOOSELEAF_INDEP__
 *     recursively explore each bucket currently selected, looking for
 *     __arg1__ leaves within all the buckets of type __arg2__ and
 *     select them.
 *
 * In all __CHOOSE__ steps, if __arg1__ is less than or equal to zero,
 * the number of items to select is equal to the __max_result__ argument
 * of crush_do_rule() minus __arg1__. It is common to set __arg1__ to zero
 * to select as many items as requested by __max_result__.
 *
 * - __CRUSH_RULE_SET_CHOOSE_TRIES__ and __CRUSH_RULE_SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES__
 *
 *   The CHOOSE_FIRSTN and CHOOSE_INDEP rule step look for buckets of
 *   a given type, randomly selecting them. If they are unlucky and
 *   find the same bucket twice, they will try N+1 times (N being the
 *   value of the choose_total_tries tunable). If there is a previous
 *   SET_CHOOSE_TRIES step in the same rule, it will try C times
 *   instead (C being the value of the argument of the
 *   SET_CHOOSE_TRIES step).
 *
 *   Note: the __choose_total_tries__ tunable defined in crush_map is
 *   the number of retry, not the number of tries. The number of tries
 *   is the number of retry+1. The SET_CHOOSE_TRIES rule step sets the
 *   number of tries and does not need the + 1. This confusing
 *   difference is inherited from an off-by-one bug from years ago.
 *
 *   The CHOOSELEAF_FIRSTN and CHOOSELEAF_INDEP rule step do the same
 *   as CHOOSE_FIRSTN and CHOOSE_INDEP but also recursively explore
 *   each bucket found, looking for a single device. The same device
 *   may be found in two different buckets because the crush map is
 *   not a strict hierarchy, it is a DAG. When such a collision
 *   happens, they will try again. The number of times they try to
 *   find a non colliding device is:
 *
 *   - If FIRSTN and there is no previous SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES rule
 *     step: try N + 1 times (N being the value of the
 *     __choose_total_tries__ tunable defined in crush_map)
 *
 *   - If FIRSTN and there is a previous SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES rule
 *     step: try P times (P being the value of the argument of the
 *     SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES rule step)
 *
 *   - If INDEP and there is no previous SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES rule
 *     step: try 1 time.
 *
 *   - If INDEP and there is a previous SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES rule step: try
 *     P times (P being the value of the argument of the SET_CHOOSELEAF_TRIES
 *     rule step)
