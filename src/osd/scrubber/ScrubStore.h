/**
 * Storing errors detected during scrubbing.
 *
 * From both functional and internal perspectives, the store is a pair of key-value
 * databases: one maps objects to shallow errors detected during their scrubbing,
 * and other stores deep errors.
 * Note that the first store is updated in both shallow and in deep scrubs. The
 * second - only while deep scrubbing.
 *
 * The DBs can be consulted by the operator, when trying to list 'errors known
 * at this point in time'. Whenever a scrub starts - the relevant entries in the
 * DBs are removed. Specifically - the shallow errors DB is recreated each scrub,
 * while the deep errors DB is recreated only when a deep scrub starts.
 *
 * When queried - the data from both DBs is merged for each named object, and
 * returned to the operator.
 *
 * Implementation:
 * Each of the two DBs is implemented as OMAP entries of a single, uniquely named,
 * object. Both DBs are cached using the general KV Cache mechanism.
