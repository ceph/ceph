/*
 * AsyncReserver for scrub 'remote' reservations
 * -----------------------------------------------
 *
 * Unless disabled by 'osd_scrub_disable_reservation_queuing' (*), scrub
 * reservation requests are handled by an async reserver: they are queued,
 * until the number of concurrent scrubs is below the configured limit.

 * (*) Note: the 'osd_scrub_disable_reservation_queuing' option is a temporary
 * debug measure, and will be removed without deprecation in a future release.
 *
 * On the replica side, all reservations are treated as having the same priority.
 * Note that 'high priority' scrubs, e.g. user-initiated scrubs, do not perform
 * reservations on replicas at all.
 *
 * A queued scrub reservation request is cancelled by any of the following events:
 *
 * - a new interval: in this case, we do not expect to see a cancellation request
 *   from the primary, and we can simply remove the request from the queue;
 *
 * - a cancellation request from the primary: probably a result of timing out on
 *   the reservation process. Here, we can simply remove the request from the queue.
 *
 * - a new reservation request for the same PG: this is a bug. We had missed the
 *   previous cancellation request, which could never happen.
 *   We cancel the previous request, and replace
 *   it with the new one. We would also issue an error log message.
 *
 * Primary/Replica with differing versions:
 *
 * The updated version of MOSDScrubReserve contains a new 'wait_for_resources'
 * field. For legacy Primary OSDs, this field is decoded as 'false', and the
 * replica responds immediately, with grant/rejection.
