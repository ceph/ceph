/**
 * Reserving/freeing scrub resources at the replicas.
 *
 * When constructed - sends reservation requests to the acting_set OSDs, one
 * by one.
 * Once a replica's OSD replies with a 'grant'ed reservation, we send a
 * reservation request to the next replica.
 * A rejection triggers a "couldn't acquire the replicas' scrub resources"
 * event. All granted reservations are released.
 *
 * Reserved replicas should be released at the end of the scrub session. The
 * one exception is if the scrub terminates upon an interval change. In that
 * scenario - the replicas discard their reservations on their own accord
 * when noticing the change in interval, and there is no need (and no
 * guaranteed way) to send them the release message.
 *
 * Timeouts:
 *
 *  Slow-Secondary Warning:
 *  Warn if a replica takes more than <conf> milliseconds to reply to a
 *  reservation request. Only one warning is issued per session.
 *
 *  Reservation Timeout:
 *  We limit the total time we wait for the replicas to respond to the
 *  reservation request. If the reservation back-and-forth does not complete
 *  within <conf> milliseconds, we give up and release all the reservations
 *  that have been acquired until that moment.
 *  (Why? because we have encountered instances where a reservation request was
 *  lost - either due to a bug or due to a network issue.)
 *
 * Keeping primary & replica in sync:
 *
 * Reservation requests may be canceled by the primary independently of the
 * replica's response. Depending on timing, a cancellation by the primary might
 * or might not be processed by a replica prior to sending a response (either
 * rejection or success).  Thus, we associate each reservation request with a
 * nonce incremented with each reservation during an interval and drop any
 * responses that do not match our current nonce.
 * This check occurs after rejecting any messages from prior intervals, so
 * reusing nonces between intervals is not a problem.  Note that epoch would
 * not suffice as it is possible for this sequence to occur several times
 * without a new map epoch.
 * Note - 'release' messages, which are not replied to by the replica,
 * do not need or use that field.
