#include "include/Context.h"

/**
 * The Continuation interface is designed to help easily create multi-step
 * operations that share data without having to pass it around or create
 * custom Context classes for each step. To write a Continuation:
 * 1) create a child class with a function for each stage.
 * 2) Put all your shared data members into the class.
 * 3) In the constructor, register each function stage with set_callback().
 * 4) Whenever you need to provide a Context callback that activates the next
 * stage, call get_callback(stage_number). If you need to proceed to another
 * stage immediately, call immediate(stage, retcode) and return its result.
 *
 * To use a class:
 * 1) Construct the child class on the heap.
 * 2) Call begin().
 * 3) The destructor will be called once one of your functions returns true to
 * indicate it is done.
 *
 * Please note that while you can skip stages and get multiple Callback
 * objects at once, you *cannot* have any stage report that the Continuation
 * is completed while any other stage Callbacks are outstanding. It's best to
 * be serial unless you want to maintain your own metadata about which stages
 * are still pending.
 *
 * In fact, there are only two situations in which a stage should return
 * true while others are running:
 * 1) A Callback was issued and completed in the same thread,
 * 2) you called immediate(stage) and it is returning true.
