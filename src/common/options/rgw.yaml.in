  long_desc: The Rados Gateway stores metadata and objects in an internal cache. This
    should be kept consistent by the OSD's relaying notify events between multiple
    watching RGW processes. In the event that this notification protocol fails, bounding
    the length of time that any data in the cache will be assumed valid will ensure
    that any RGW instance that falls out of sync will eventually recover. This seems
    to be an issue mostly for large numbers of RGW instances under heavy use. If you
    would like to turn off cache expiry, set this value to zero.
