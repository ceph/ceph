  long_desc: Use this setting to control the granularity of time series data collection
    from daemons.  Adjust upwards if the manager CPU load is too high, or if you simply
    do not require the most up to date performance counter data.

  services:
  - mgr
- name: mgr_standby_modules
  type: bool
  default: true
  level: advanced
  desc: Start modules in standby (redirect) mode when mgr is standby
  long_desc: By default, the standby modules will answer incoming requests with a
    HTTP redirect to the active manager, allowing users to point their browser at any
    mgr node and find their way to an active mgr.  However, this mode is problematic
    when using a load balancer because (1) the redirect locations are usually private
    IPs and (2) the load balancer can't identify which mgr is the right one to send
    traffic to. If a load balancer is being used, set this to false.
- name: mgr_disabled_modules
  type: str
  level: advanced
  desc: List of manager modules never get loaded
  long_desc: A comma delimited list of module names. This list is read by manager
    when it starts. By default, manager loads all modules found in specified 'mgr_module_path',
    and it starts the enabled ones as instructed. The modules in this list will not
    be loaded at all.

  long_desc: This list of module names is read by the monitor when the cluster is
    first started after installation, to populate the list of enabled manager modules.  Subsequent
    updates are done using the 'mgr module [enable|disable]' commands.  List may be
    comma or space separated.

  fmt_desc: Seconds of inactivity before we reset the PG delta to 0. We keep
    track of the delta of the used space of each pool, so, for
    example, it would be easier for us to understand the progress of
    recovery or the performance of cache tier. But if there's no
    activity reported for a certain pool, we just reset the history of
    deltas of that pool.

    of any pool is greater than ``mon_pg_warn_max_object_skew`` times
    the average RADOS object count per PG of all pools. Zero or a non-positive
    number disables this. Note that this option applies to ``ceph-mgr`` daemons.

  desc: Automated PG management creates this many PGs per OSD
  long_desc: When creating pools, the automated PG management logic will attempt to
    reach this target.  In some circumstances, it may exceed this target, up to the
    ``mon_max_pg_per_osd`` limit. Conversely, a lower number of PGs per OSD may be
    created if the cluster is not yet fully utilised
