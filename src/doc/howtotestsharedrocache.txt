0. setup a parent image and a clone image

```
rbd create testimage --size 100M
rbd snap create testimage@snap1
rbd snap protect testimage@snap1
rbd clone testimage@snap1 child_image
```

1. start the ceph-immutable-obj-cache daemon

```
ceph-immutable-obj-cache
```
The obj cache will be promoted to /tmp/ceph_immutable_obj_cache/, the total cache size is set to 1G.
By default this feature is disabled, so you may change these params by setting new values in ceph.conf, like:
```
rbd shared cache enabled = true
immutable object cache path = /mnt/cache # SSD based cache dir
immutable object cache max size = 16G
```
For now the daemon simply cleans all cache on start. So if you have lots of old cache, it may take while to start

2. start randread or read jobs against child image
Note this is a shared ro cache. So all writes will go to RADOS directly and only read can benefit from the cache
