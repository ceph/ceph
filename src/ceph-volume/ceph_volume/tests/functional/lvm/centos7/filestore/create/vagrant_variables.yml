# VAGRANT BOX
# Ceph boxes are *strongly* suggested. They are under better control and will
# not get updated frequently unless required for build systems. These are (for
# now):
#
# * ceph/ubuntu-xenial
#
# Ubuntu: ceph/ubuntu-xenial bento/ubuntu-16.04 or ubuntu/trusty64 or ubuntu/wily64
# CentOS: bento/centos-7.1 or puppetlabs/centos-7.0-64-puppet
# libvirt CentOS: centos/7
# parallels Ubuntu: parallels/ubuntu-14.04
# Debian: deb/jessie-amd64 - be careful the storage controller is named 'SATA Controller'
# For more boxes have a look at:
#   - https://atlas.hashicorp.com/boxes/search?utf8=✓&sort=&provider=virtualbox&q=
#   - https://download.gluster.org/pub/gluster/purpleidea/vagrant/
vagrant_box: centos/7
#ssh_private_key_path: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
# The sync directory changes based on vagrant box
# Set to /home/vagrant/sync for Centos/7, /home/{ user }/vagrant for openstack and defaults to /vagrant
#vagrant_sync_dir: /home/vagrant/sync
#vagrant_sync_dir: /
# Disables synced folder creation. Not needed for testing, will skip mounting
# the vagrant directory on the remote box regardless of the provider.
vagrant_disable_synced_folder: true
# VAGRANT URL
# This is a URL to download an image from an alternate location.  vagrant_box
# above should be set to the filename of the image.
