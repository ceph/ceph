* right now, functions that take a commit parameter generally only commit on success; should we also commit on failure? 

* I started to implement vivification


* TLI improvements:
    - if you pass a txn, use that txn
    - if passed dbh, create txn

    - default commit mode (reads: no; mutations: yes)

* OOP helper (or lambda helper) to bind dbh, we don't need that param, either.

* Some "missing" things (might make a great intro project):
    - fdb_get_max_api_version()

Because this file is VERY hard to find:
    fdbclient/vexillographer/fdb.options
...the relationship between client library, bindings, and documentation in this project is
logical but neither clear and nor "obvious" from the documentation. Stuff gets generated from
this, and the documentation references generated files that may or may not exist at the time
you read the documentation (for example).
