* right now, functions that take a commit parameter generally only commit on success; should we also commit on failure? 

* I started to implement vivification


* TLI improvements:
    - if you pass a txn, use that txn
    - if passed dbh, create txn

    - default commit mode (reads: no; mutations: yes)

* OOP helper (or lambda helper) to bind dbh, we don't need that param, either.
