    @brief Interface provided by erasure code plugins

    The erasure coded pools rely on plugins implementing
    **ErasureCodeInterface** to encode and decode content. All codes
    are systematic (i.e. the data is not mangled and can be
    reconstructed by concatenating chunks ).
    
    Methods returning an **int** return **0** on success and a
    negative value on error. If the value returned on error is not
    explained in **ErasureCodeInterface**, the sources or the
    documentation of the interface implementer (i.e. the plugin ) must
    be read to figure out what it means. It is recommended that each
    error code matches an *errno* value that relates to the cause of
    the error.

    If an object is small enough, the caller can process it with
    one call to the **encode** or **decode** method.

	+---------------- coded object O -------------------------+
	|+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+ |
	||    chunk  0    | |    chunk  1    | |    chunk  2    | |
	||    [0,N)       | |    [N,2N)      | |    [2N,3N)     | |
	|+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+ |
	+------^--------------------------------------------------+
	       |
   chunk B / C | offset B % C ( where C is the chunk size )
	       |
	 +-----^---- raw object O ----+------+
	 |     B     [0,X)            | pad  |
	 +----------------------------+------+

    The object size is paded so that each chunks are of the same size.
    In the example above, if the actual object size was X, then it
    will be padded to 2N >= X assuming there are two data chunks (0
    and 1) and one coding chunk (2).

    For chunks of size C, byte B of the object is found in chunk number
    B / C at offset B % C.

    If an object is too large to be encoded in memory, the caller
    should divide it in smaller units named **stripes**.

	+---------------------- object O -------------------------+
	|+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+ |
 stripe ||    chunk  0    | |    chunk  1    | |    chunk  2    | |
   0    ||    [0,N)       | |    [N,2N)      | |    [2N,3N)     | |
	|+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+ |
	|+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+ |
 stripe ||    chunk  0    | |    chunk  1    | |    chunk  2    | |
   1    ||    [X,M)       | |   [X+M,X+2M)   | |   [X+2M,X+3M)  | |
	||                | |                | |                | |
	|+----------------+ +----------------+ +----------------+ |
	|                         ...                             |
	+---------------------------------------------------------+

    The interface does not concern itself with stripes nor does it
    impose constraints on the size of each stripe. Variable names in
    the interface always use **object** and never use **stripe**. 

    Assuming the interface implementer provides three data chunks ( K
    = 3 ) and two coding chunks ( M = 2 ), a buffer could be encoded as
    follows:
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
    set<int> want_to_encode(0, 1, 2, // data chunks
                            3, 4     // coding chunks
                           );
    bufferlist in = "ABCDEF";
    map<int, bufferlist> encoded
    encode(want_to_encode, in, &encoded);
    encoded[0] == "AB" // data chunk 0
    encoded[1] == "CD" // data chunk 1
    encoded[2] == "EF" // data chunk 2
    encoded[3]         // coding chunk 0
    encoded[4]         // coding chunk 1
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The **minimum_to_decode_with_cost** method can be used to minimize
    the cost of fetching the chunks necessary to retrieve a given
    content. For instance, if encoded[2] (contained **EF**) is missing
    and accessing encoded[3] (the first coding chunk) is more
    expensive than accessing encoded[4] (the second coding chunk),
    **minimum_to_decode_with_cost** is expected to chose the first
    coding chunk.

    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
    set<int> want_to_read(2); // want the chunk containing "EF"
    map<int,int> available(
          0 => 1,  // data chunk 0 : available and costs 1
          1 => 1,  // data chunk 1 : available and costs 1
                   // data chunk 2 : missing
          3 => 9,  // coding chunk 1 : available and costs 9
          4 => 1,  // coding chunk 2 : available and costs 1
    );
    set<int> minimum;
    minimum_to_decode_with_cost(want_to_read,
                                available,
                                &minimum);
    minimum == set<int>(0, 1, 4); // NOT set<int>(0, 1, 3);
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    
    It sets **minimum** with three chunks to reconstruct the desired
    data chunk and will pick the second coding chunk ( 4 ) because it
    is less expensive ( 1 < 9 ) to retrieve than the first coding
    chunk ( 3 ). The caller is responsible for retrieving the chunks
    and call **decode** to reconstruct the second data chunk.
    
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.c}
    map<int,bufferlist> chunks;
    for i in minimum.keys():
      chunks[i] = fetch_chunk(i); // get chunk from storage
    map<int, bufferlist> decoded;
    decode(want_to_read, chunks, &decoded);
    decoded[2] == "EF"
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    The semantic of the cost value is defined by the caller and must
    be known to the implementer. For instance, it may be more
    expensive to retrieve two chunks with cost 1 + 9 = 10 than two
    chunks with cost 6 + 6 = 12.
