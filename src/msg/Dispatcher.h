   * dispatch it requires that you:

   * locks. (This function is likely to be called in-line with message
   * receipt.)
   * 2) Be able to accept the Message even if you have not yet received
   * an ms_handle_accept() notification for the Connection it is associated
   * with, and even if you *have* called mark_down() or received an
   * ms_handle_reset() (or similar) call on the Connection. You will
   * not receive more than one dead "message" (and should generally be
   * prepared for that circumstance anyway, since the normal dispatch can begin,
   * then trigger Connection failure before it's percolated through your system).
   * We provide ms_handle_fast_[connect|accept] calls if you need them, under
   * similar speed and state constraints as fast_dispatch itself.
   * 3) Be able to make a determination on fast_dispatch without relying
   * on particular system state -- the ms_can_fast_dispatch() call might
   * be called multiple times on a single message; the state might change between
   * calling ms_can_fast_dispatch and ms_fast_dispatch; etc.
