/*
 * Notes on deprecation:
 *
 * For feature bits used *only* on the server-side:
 *
 *  - In the first phase we indicate that a feature is DEPRECATED as of
 *    a particular release.  This is the first major release X (say,
 *    mimic) that does not depend on its peers advertising the feature.
 *    That is, it safely assumes its peers all have the feature.  We
 *    indicate this with the DEPRECATED macro.  For example,
 *
 *      DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_DEPRECATED( 2, 1, MON_METADATA, MIMIC)
 *
 *    because 13.2.z (mimic) did not care if its peers advertised this
 *    feature bit.
 *
 *  - In the second phase we stop advertising the the bit and call it
 *    RETIRED.  This can normally be done 2 major releases
 *    following the one in which we marked the feature DEPRECATED.  In
 *    the above example, for 15.0.z (octopus) we can say:
 *
 *      DEFINE_CEPH_FEATURE_RETIRED( 2, 1, MON_METADATA, MIMIC, OCTOPUS)
 *
 *  - The bit can be reused in the next release that will never talk to
 *    a pre-octopus daemon (13 mimic or 14 nautlius) that advertises the
 *    bit: in this case, the 16.y.z (P-release).
 *
 * This ensures that no two versions who have different meanings for
 * the bit ever speak to each other.
 */

/*
 * Notes on the kernel client:
 *
 * - "X" means that the feature bit has been advertised and supported
 *   since kernel X
 *
 * - "X req" means that the feature bit has been advertised and required
 *   since kernel X
 *
 * The remaining feature bits are not and have never been used by the
 * kernel client.
