##
# Sample ceph ceph.conf file.
##
# This file defines cluster membership, the various locations
# that Ceph stores data, and any other runtime options.

# If a 'host' is defined for a daemon, the init.d start/stop script will
# verify that it matches the hostname (or else ignore it).  If it is
# not defined, it is assumed that the daemon is intended to start on
# the current host (e.g., in a setup with a startup.conf on each
# node).

## Metavariables
# $cluster    ; Expands to the Ceph Storage Cluster name. Useful
#             ; when running multiple Ceph Storage Clusters
#             ; on the same hardware.
#             ; Example: /etc/ceph/$cluster.keyring
#             ; (Default: ceph)
#
# $type       ; Expands to one of mds, osd, or mon, depending on
#             ; the type of the instant daemon.
#             ; Example: /var/lib/ceph/$type
#
# $id         ; Expands to the daemon identifier. For osd.0, this
#             ; would be 0; for mds.a, it would be a.
#             ; Example: /var/lib/ceph/$type/$cluster-$id
#
# $host       ; Expands to the host name of the instant daemon.
#
# $name       ; Expands to $type.$id.
