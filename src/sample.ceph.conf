; Sample ceph ceph.conf file.
;
; This file defines cluster membership, the various locations
; that Ceph stores data, and any other runtime options.

; If a 'host' is defined for a daemon, the start/stop script will
; verify that it matches the hostname (or else ignore it).  If it is
; not defined, it is assumed that the daemon is intended to start on
; the current host (e.g., in a setup with a startup.conf on each
; node).

; The variables $type, $id and $name are available to use in paths
; $type = The type of daemon, possible values: mon, mds and osd
; $id = The ID of the daemon, for mon.alpha, $id will be alpha
; $name = $type.$id

; For example:
; osd.0
;  $type = osd
;  $id = 0
;  $name = osd.0

; mon.beta
;  $type = mon
;  $id = beta
;  $name = mon.beta
