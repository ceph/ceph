   Run ceph on two nodes, using one of them as a client,
   with a separate client-only node.
   Use xfs beneath the osds.
   install ceph/squid v19.2.1 and the subsequent v19.2.x point versions
   run workload and upgrade-sequence in parallel
   (every point release should be tested)
   run workload and upgrade-sequence in parallel
   install ceph/squid  latest version
   run workload and upgrade-sequence in parallel
   Overall upgrade path is - squid-latest.point-1 => squid-latest.point => squid-latest
