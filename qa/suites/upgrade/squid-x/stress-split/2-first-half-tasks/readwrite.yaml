   randomized correctness test for rados operations on a replicated pool,
   using only reads, writes, and deletes
first-half-tasks:
- full_sequential:
  - rados:
      clients: [client.0]
      ops: 4000
      objects: 500
      write_append_excl: false
      op_weights:
        read: 45
        write: 45
        delete: 10
- print: "**** done rados/readwrite 5-workload"
