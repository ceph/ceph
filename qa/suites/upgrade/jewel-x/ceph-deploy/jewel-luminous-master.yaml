    Setup 4 node ceph cluster using ceph-deploy, use latest
    stable jewel as initial release, upgrade to stable luminous and
    also setup mgr nodes along after upgrade, check for cluter to
    reach healthy state and run kernel tar/untar task. Finally upgrade
    to master dev branch and wait for healthy state, Run systemd and
    mixed-load gen task. This test will detect any ceph upgrade issue
    and systemd issues.
