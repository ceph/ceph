    Setup 4 node ceph cluster using ceph-deploy, use latest
    stable jewel as initial release, upgrade to luminous and
    also setup mgr nodes along after upgrade, check for
    cluster to reach healthy state, After upgrade run kernel tar/untar
    task and systemd task. This test will detect any
    ceph upgrade issue and systemd issues.
