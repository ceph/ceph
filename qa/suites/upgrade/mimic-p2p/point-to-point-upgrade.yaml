   Run ceph on two nodes, using one of them as a client,
   with a separate client-only node. 
   Use xfs beneath the osds.

   run workload and upgrade-sequence in parallel
   install ceph/mimic v13.2.1 point version
   run workload and upgrade-sequence in parallel
   install ceph/mimic v13.2.x point version
   (every point reslease should be tested)
   run workload and upgrade-sequence in parallel
   install ceph/mimic latest version
