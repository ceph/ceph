This suite upgrades the client (octopus to quincy) and then sets a compat flag
for one of the client and then expects the other client to get evicted.

This suite upgrades to quincy, once quincy reaches EOL, this suite will need
to be removed or we'll have to cook up a dummy feature so that we can test
client eviction with recent (supported) release.
