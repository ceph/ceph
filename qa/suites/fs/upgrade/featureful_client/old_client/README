This suite checks if an upgraded mds can evict older clients after the file
system is set with `required_client_features`, specifically `metric_collect`.
So, octopus clients do not support `metric_collect` and the test verifies
this.

This suite upgrades to quincy, once quincy reaches EOL, this suite will need
to be removed.
