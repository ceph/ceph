qa/standalone
=============

These scripts run standalone clusters, but not in a normal way.  They make
use of functions ceph-helpers.sh to quickly start/stop daemons against
toy clusters in a single directory.

They are normally run via teuthology based on qa/suites/rados/standalone/*.yaml.

You can run them in a git checkout + build directory as well:

  * The qa/run-standalone.sh will run all of them in sequence.  This is slow
     since there is no parallelism.

  * You can run individual script(s) by specifying the basename or path below
    qa/standalone as arguments to qa/run-standalone.sh.

../qa/run-standalone.sh misc.sh osd/osd-dup.sh

  * Add support for specifying arguments to selected tests by simply adding
    list of tests to each argument.

../qa/run-standalone.sh "test-ceph-helpers.sh test_get_last_scrub_stamp"
