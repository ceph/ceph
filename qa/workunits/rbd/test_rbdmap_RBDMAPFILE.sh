# Regression test for http://tracker.ceph.com/issues/14984

# When the bug is present, starting the rbdmap service causes
# a bogus log message to be emitted to the log because the RBDMAPFILE
# environment variable is not set.
#
# When the bug is not present, starting the rbdmap service will emit
# no log messages, because /etc/ceph/rbdmap does not contain any lines
# that require processing.
