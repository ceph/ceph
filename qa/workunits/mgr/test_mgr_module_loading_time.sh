# This script tests how the mgr handles different module loading times post failover.
# The motivation is this tracker ticket: https://tracker.ceph.com/issues/71631

# To run this script on a vstart cluter, use the following command:
#   cd ceph/build
#   ../qa/workunits/mgr/test_mgr_module_loading_time.sh --vstart

vstart=0

    vstart=1
