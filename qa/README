The suites directory has a hierarchical collection of tests.  This can be
freeform, but generally follows the convention of

  suites/<test suite name>/<test group>/...

A test is described by a yaml fragment.

A test can exist as a single .yaml file in the directory tree.  For example:

 suites/foo/one.yaml
 suites/foo/two.yaml

is a simple group of two tests.

A directory with a magic '+' file represents a test that combines all
other items in the directory into a single yaml fragment.  For example:

 suites/foo/bar/+
 suites/foo/bar/a.yaml
 suites/foo/bar/b.yaml
 suites/foo/bar/c.yaml

is a single test consisting of a + b + c.

A directory with a magic '%' file represents a test matrix formed from
all other items in the directory.  For example,

 suites/baz/%
 suites/baz/a.yaml
 suites/baz/b/b1.yaml
 suites/baz/b/b2.yaml
 suites/baz/c.yaml
 suites/baz/d/d1.yaml
 suites/baz/d/d2.yaml

is a 4-dimensional test matrix.  Two dimensions (a, c) are trivial (1
item), so this is really 2x2 = 4 tests, which are

  a + b1 + c + d1
  a + b1 + c + d2
  a + b2 + c + d1
  a + b2 + c + d2

A directory with a magic '$' file, or a directory whose name ends with '$',
represents a test where one of the non-magic items is chosen randomly.  For
example, both

 suites/foo/$
 suites/foo/a.yaml
 suites/foo/b.yaml
 suites/foo/c.yaml

and

 suites/foo$/a.yaml
 suites/foo$/b.yaml
 suites/foo$/c.yaml

is a single test, either a, b or c.  This can be used in conjunction with the
'%' file in the same (see below) or other directories to run a series of tests
without causing an unwanted increase in the total number of jobs run.

Symlinks are okay.

One particular use of symlinks is to combine '%' and the latter form of '$'
feature.  Consider supported_distros directory containing fragments that define
os_type and os_version:

 supported_distros/%
 supported_distros/centos.yaml
 supported_distros/rhel.yaml
 supported_distros/ubuntu.yaml

A test that links supported_distros as distros (a name that doesn't end with
'$') will be run three times: on centos, rhel and ubuntu.  A test that links
supported_distros as distros$ will be run just once: either on centos, rhel or
ubuntu, chosen randomly.

Note: The performance suites clone CBT from master here: https://github.com/ceph/cbt.git
CBT will not support cosbench beyond release tag v0.3, therefore no qa suite should use cosbench.
cosbench support has been removed from qa/tasks/cbt.py.
