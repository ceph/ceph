ceph_install.sh installs a ceph cluster using the cdn and ceph-ansible.

Right now, it takes 5 parameters -- an admin node, a ceph mon node, and
three osd nodes.

In order to subscribe to the cdn, in your home directory create a file named
secrets, (~/secrets), that contains the following lines:

subscrname=Your-Redhat-Cdn-Id
subscrpassword=Your-Redhat-Cdn-Password

If you want to set the monitor_interface or the public_network values,
in your home directory create a file named ip_info (~/ip_info), that
contains the following lines: 

mon_intf=your-monitor-interface (default is eno1)
pub_netw=public-network (default is 10.8.128.0/21)

This script first subscribes to the cdn, enables the rhel 7 repos, and does
a yum update.  (multi_action.sh performs all the actions on all nodes at once,
staller.sh is used to make sure that all updates are complete before exiting,
and execs/cdn_setup.sh is used to remotely update the cdn information.

After that, it makes sure that all nodes can connect via passwordless ssh
(using talknice.sh and config) and then installs the appropriate repos and
runs ceph_ansible on the admin node using execs/ceph_ansible.sh,
execs/edit_ansible_hosts.sh and execs/edit_groupvars_osds.sh.

repolocs.sh contains the locations of repo files.  These variables can
be changed if one wishes to use different urls.
