Using Large Language Models with Ceph
=====================================

Submitting Code Generated by an LLM
-----------------------------------
The Ceph project allows developers to submit code they have generated with the aid of an LLM. However, we expect disclosure as part of the Pull Request process, and some teams may apply stricter rules or refuse to accept patches which do not meet minimum standards for review. Always remember: you are responsible for code you submit. The Developer's Certificate of Origin is a legal statement.

When submitting a PR with code that was generated by an LLM, disclose it. You should include more information about the LLM as the proportion of code it generated rises. If you used an IDE with LLM-based code completion, you can simply state as much in the PR description. If you used an LLM to generate whole functions, classes, or files, you should discuss the LLM and prompt you used in the commit message — even if you then edit it by hand. Be prepared for questions about how you validated the LLM's output is correct and reasonable before more meaningful feedback; if you discuss this up-front you will save everybody's time!

Some teams and code areas will have different standards than others. Check for the sections below and use common sense around what kinds of things LLMs are good and bad at handling when using them for submissions!

cephadm:
CephFS: Please do not submit MDS or Client code which was generated by an LLM. Our invariants are not clear nor well-represented in training databases.
Crimson:
Dashboard: (LLMs are well-suited to handling websites and databases, right?)
Documentation: 
RADOS: 
RBD: 
RGW:

Using Ceph code and documentation to train LLMs
-----------------------------------------------
Ceph's code is open source and mostly available under the LGPL (2.1 or 3.0; though miscellaneous parts and API connectors may be under another license). Its documentation is licensed under CC-BY-SA-3.0. We cannot stop anybody from training an LLM, nor do we want to.

However, please be aware of these differing licenses! Many LLM datasets are licensed under non-copyleft open source licenses. You cannot take substantial portions of Ceph's code (including its help text!) and share it under any license other than the LGPL; nor are the LGPL and CC-BY-SA licenses compatible — if you host or share Ceph code and documentation as part of another repository, you must maintain multiple licenses as well.
