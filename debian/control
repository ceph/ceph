 performance, reliability, and scalability.
 .
 This package contains all server daemons and management tools for creating,
 running, and administering a Ceph storage cluster, with the exception of the
 metadata server, which is necessary for using the distributed file system and is
 provided by the ceph-mds package.

 limitations, it is recommended that the native Linux kernel client
 be used if possible.  If it is not practical to load a kernel module
 (insufficient privileges, older kernel, etc.), then the FUSE client will
 do.
