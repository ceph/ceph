Description: distributed storage and file system
 Ceph is a distributed storage and network file system designed to provide
 excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.

Package: ceph-fuse
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}, libfuse2
Recommends: fuse-utils
Suggests: ceph
Description: FUSE-based client for the Ceph distributed file system
 Ceph is a distributed network file system designed to provide
 excellent performance, reliability, and scalability.  This is a
 FUSE-based client that allows you to mount a Ceph file system without
 root privileges.
 .
 Because the FUSE-based client has certain inherent performance
 limitations, it is recommended that the native Linux kernel client
 be used if possible.  If it is not practical to load a kernel module
 (insufficient privileges, older kernel, etc.), then the FUSE client will
 do.

Description: CRUSH placement algorithm
 CRUSH is a pseudo-random hash-like algorithm for mapping inputs to
 a changing hierarchy of devices without a centralized directory.  It was
 originally designed for mapping data objects to storage servers, although it
 may be useful in other domains.  Because large systems are inherently
 dynamic, CRUSH is designed to facilitate the addition and removal of devices
 while minimizing unnecessary object movement.  The algorithm accommodates a
 wide variety of data replication and reliability mechanisms and distributes
 data in terms of user-defined policies that enforce separation of replicas
 across failure domains.
